Believe it or not. It's the simple and the complicated, It's the usual and the different, It's the mind and the heart, It's an emotional and psychological journey through the unknown which has its own stunning visuals. It's an original story and thought-provoking masterpiece.Every single time with him, you just got crazy about his ideas, astonished by his mind games and inspired when he talks to the heart.Back then, he was an ambitious young director. And with his capabilities made his own way straight through the world. Now, he is an icon and a legend of directing. He is Christopher Nolan...Really guys, what's wrong with this guy ?!! what's going on inside his head ?!!It's our job to honor the honorable. Please, Just keep the rating UP, why ? Because Chris. and Interstellar deserve it."

I am a huge Christopher Nolan fan and this movie was his finest. Matthew McConaughey turned in his best performance of his lifetime. Anne Hathaway was an amazing supporting actress and compared to her performance in Les Miserables, I have no idea how she didn't get an Oscar for this. The visual effects were more than just Oscar worthy. They were pioneering. I have never seen anything like it. One thing I would recommend is having a little previous knowledge about space. Not like Einstein stuff though. I would recommend you see this movie as fast as you can if you are a Nolan fan or not. I give this movie a rating of 97 out of 100."
3,7,0.032200646,0.11265449,0.85514474,10,'Interstellar',"'Interstellar' was incredible. The visuals, the score, the acting, were all amazing. The plot is definitely one of the most original I've seen in a while. Most of the critic reviews have said that some bits are a little too unbelievable, but I have to disagree. Yes, there were some parts that were definitely in the ""fi"" part of sci-fi. But the thing is, 'Interstellar' deals with concepts that we know very little about. We have no idea what the 4th or 5th dimension is like, or what it would be like to go through a wormhole or a black hole. I don't think it's fair to call something unbelievable, when we have absolutely no idea what WOULD be believable in those circumstances. Either way, excellent writing from the Nolan brothers. The visuals were outstanding, and will no doubt be nominated for an Oscar. The performances were excellent, though nothing Oscar worthy, as is the case with most of Nolan's films ('The Dark Knight' being the obvious exception). Hans Zimmer's score was amazing and blended perfectly with the film. All in all, 'Interstellar' is an excellent movie, which I personally think is Nolan's most beautiful film to date."
4,8,0.050086893,0.24609429,0.7038188,10,Epic in every way!,"Just watched Interstellar in imax 70mm. Science Fiction fans can read on, everyone else can skip. Movie is a visual masterpiece. Like his earlier movies, Christopher Nolan once again proved, how big a movie can be! There were some shots,which made audience go crazy..Some scenes were as epic as 2001: A Space Odyssey. Do not go into the theatre expecting an action packed cerebral thriller. This one is not for action fans. At times, movie go highly sentimental( Matthew McConaughey does what he is best in and supposed to). I recommend this movie to all the Sci-Fi fans out there, make sure you go in group of sci-fi nuts!! Do not go with the hype..Go, sit back and enjoy. Just like Inception, this movie will be known as great after few months(I know people who said Inception was a crap when it released, and after few months rating it 10/10 in IMDb :D). I don't wanna spoil anything(If you want PM me). Also, make sure you go to the best theatre close to you. (If you loved Donnie Darko, 2001: A Space Odyssey, this is the one for you, Get ready to get mind blown!!) Interstellar Movie is EPIC in all sense!!"

Seriously guys??? This film has 5/10 stars at best, and even that for just potential. Rest of it is lost because the film has absolutely no logic to it.Stupid, illogical and at times really boring and long. Even though I am no scientist, it was so stupid on so many levels with even the most basic of facts that I have no comments to this....Set your expectations low- no way in hell does this film deserve any of that praise posted here...."

Well, I watched this movie all the way through with no bathroom breaks. My interest was grabbed from the start and held all the way through. Being old enough, and lucky enough to have watched the premiere of 2001 A Space Odyssey - and viewed it several times since - of course I made comparisons, and there were a few, but this movie tells an excellent stand alone story that is both riveting and believable. I'm not going to give away any secrets but anyone who watches the last five minutes or so without a lump in their throat and a tear in their eye, well you're a critic, you're not enjoying the movie because you're too busy looking for bloopers and faults. Were there bloopers and faults? The darn movie was so riveting if there were any I didn't notice them!"

And so was the Film for me.Why you might ask?Well seldom do i get the chance where i find myself sitting in a cinema anxious and intrigued by what might come. In a time where trailers are omnipresent and going to the movies without having seen one seems unreasonable, outright stupid to some i had the magical chance to find myself in front of the IMAX on a cold November night with 2 tickets to Interstellar. My only knowledge was that Nolan directed it and McConaughey stars in it.The images were brilliant the acting was top notch and everything was blended together by Hans Zimmer and his Music. 169 minutes flew by me with my eyes fixed on the screen and my heart racing. And there it was.. The ending. I couldn't believe it . I was reliving, rethinking the movie while the credit scenes rolled enjoying the moment, the smell of popcorn, my comfortable seat and what do i see next to me? Ninety percent of the people in the cinema rushing outside after the first second of the credit scenes. .. .Well apparently people enjoy movies different than i do. Maybe i should start watching trailers again :)."
8,17,0.65152484,0.27037883,0.07809636,4,Poor in almost every possible way.,"Yesterday I watched the movie ""Interstellar"". A poorly scripted and poorly directed movie with an over-simplified pseudo-science and spoon-fed philosophical implications, basically a typically overrated Hollywood movie which takes no shame in copying from 2001: A Space Odyssey from Kubrick with none of its beauty, simplicity and none of its art. It shows that in 1968 they were able to make a masterpiece and in 2014 they can't even copy it decently. The fact that on IMDb it has an higher rating than the Kubrick masterpiece makes me lose all faith in the progress of humanity and in our current generation. I will watch 2001: A space odyssey again to forget about it and restore faith in human kind again."

Its plot is up there with ""armaggeddon"" in pure stupidity and forced US-cowboy-patriot-macho-ism, its special effects are underwhelming, its plot twists are obvious, its setting makes no sense, its characters are flat and forgettable, and its constant citations of ""2001"" just serve to make you remember how much better Kubrick did all of this with a tiny fraction of the money almost 50 years back.Disappointing."

12,21,0.034018014,0.16487576,0.80110615,10,Out of this world,"A lot has been said and written about Interstellar. You can obviously take apart any movie that is out there. You'll either love this one or you won't. I kind of would have loved to have watched this on an IMAX screen, the sheer scope of the whole thing. It's just amazing, what Nolan has put on screen here. It's not only the visual experience (there is no 3D here by the way), it's the story/ride you take with it. It might be clear to some earlier than to others, where it's heading (no pun intended), but it doesn't change the fact that it's beautiful ... and terrifying at the same time.Going out and saying this will be considered a classic, might not be too far stretched, but you still can never predict those things. The deserved love the movie gets on IMDb and other places would be an indicator that this will ring true though. The acting is really good, but I can understand if some people have issues with the ending. But the movie had to end in one way or another. It's the best possible way this could go, even if it's not in our grasps just yet ..."
13,22,0.9384165,0.053416334,0.008167119,1,"Long, dull and WAY overpraised","A simple farm guy named Copper (Matthew McConaughey) and a few other experts go into outer space to explore other worlds that might sustain human life. It seems that that life on Earth might not survive due to to some unexplained environmental disaster. Naturally nothing goes right.WAY overpraised and terrible sci-fi movie. When I heard the plot from this I expected the worst. Writer/director Christopher Nolan has never been a favorite for me--I HATE what he did to Batman in his movie trilogy. I thought that he as trying to imitate Stanley Kubrick (""2001"") here but it's far worse--he's doing Steven Spielberg! The movie runs WAY too long (165 minutes) and they're constantly pushing family friendly values in your face. Cooper's non-stop yammering about his daughter got on my nerves instantly. Also that stupid fake southern accent he adopts is immediately annoying. The story is very slow and all the characters are cardboard cutouts you've seen in other movies. The special effects are flawless and there's some beautiful cinematography here but the extreme length and boring story really weigh it down. Any sort of statement they're trying to make on time and life is completely deadened by the script. Also this movie is very manipulative and way too sentimental. They go out of their way to make the audience cry--like at a Spielberg movie. Well I did cry--tears of joy at the end that this was over! Also the gaps in logic and plot holes here are very annoying. I lost track of how many times I rolled my eyes at the dubious ""logic"" served up here. The acting was as good as it could be (I guess) but, at the end, they throw in a surprise guest star (who I won't name). It didn't help because I think he's a terrible actor and this didn't change my mind. I was bored and looked at my watch MANY times while this played. It's boring, obvious and manipulative. Why is this getting so much praise? Skip it."

This story is thin, the characters are under developed, the emotional and logical shortcuts are ridiculous, Matt Damon is horribly cast and has become a caricature of himself, the set pieces are not inspiring, the music cues try to be bombastic enough to create emotion that simply doesn't exist and the science is a mess. When a self-important filmmaker reaches a level of success where no one will tell them ""no"" anymore, this is what comes of it. The scientific equation that sums up this film is as follows: Nolan + Interstellar = Lucas/Spielberg + Crystal Skull. A completely unremarkable and forgettable film. The Emperor truly has no clothes."
15,26,0.88790387,0.09788378,0.01421224,1,What a Waste of Space,"This truly is a shocking movie and must rank as the worst sci-fi film I have ever had the misfortune to waste 2.5hrs on.The acting is appalling with some quite amateurish edits. The music drowns out a lot of the dialogue, which is probably just as well considering its triteness. The whole premise of the plot seems to have been cobbled together by the writers after they'd endured an overkill of everything from the Lost in Space TV series of the sixties (though at least that show injected some humour into the proceedings), through to 2001 A Space Odyssey, and the innumerable Star Trek programmes and films.Any movie that casts Michael Caine as a scientific boffin must be struggling for starters. He utters, in one excruciatingly and barely decipherable scene, ""I lied"". Well he certainly didn't act! Anne Hathaway struggles to make any sense of the quite ludicrous script and often appears that she'd rather be undergoing root-canal work, whilst Matthew McConaughey mumbles and fumbles his way through lines he can't quite believe he is expected to say.The continuity is confusing and the 'special effects' only reach mediocre, adding absolutely nothing new in this genre for the viewer.I have watched hundreds of sci-fi films and programmes and do realise that we are expected to suspend belief to a greater extent, which is why a little humour would not have gone amiss - but every character in the movie seemed to be so darn miserable and brimming with angst. This film has no redeeming features whatsoever; one develops no empathy for any of the players, and there were a couple I longed would perish within a few minutes of them being introduced into the storyline (the child who portrays the ten-year old Murphy to name but one).Sorry, but this film is not worthy of wasting over two hours of your precious life on. There again, you are quite entitled to think otherwise...."
16,27,0.5228029,0.37708375,0.10011341,1,One of the most ludicrous films ever made,"Truly one of the most ludicrous films ever made. Virtually every moment of the film comprises a series of linked premises without any one of them having a rational basis. The film depends upon multiple concepts regarding space-time and space travel, most of which the audience is sufficiently familiar with to appreciate the potential story .... BUT ... each one of those is then formulated and entered into the storyline in a way that you cannot suspend belief. The series of presumptions just accumulate one ludicrous outcome after another, just in time to be posted straight into another ludicrous presumption. So what builds is a stack of preposterous situations that can really only be ""resolved"" by yet another, even more ludicrous outcome. This causes the late stages of the film to become so disjointed that the basic premise collapses.Note that the suspension of belief is, of course, fundamental to many films - in Star Trek for example, one suspends belief in accepting that faster than light travel is possible - or falling asleep inside your own dreams is believable, as in Inception - and that's AOK because the rest of the action is consistent. However, the number of presumptions you have swallow in Interstellar, that have no basis in science fiction or reality, strains credulity way past breaking point. One at least has to see a consistency for a film to be acceptable. Notwithstanding these comments, the individual elements are each highly watchable and Nolan does his usual blinding (literally in couple of the shots) best. The environments and space scenes are quite breathtaking. However, watching the film is a cascaded cataclysm of ideas, concepts, half-theories, impossibilities, broken linkages and downright wrongness, that appears on the screen like confetti in a gale. The disappointment is that the cast of actors is sensational, and they do everything they can to make the film a coherent ""reality"" .... but the outcome it to make them look like patsies to a conspiracy ...Possibly the only saving grace is the final 38 seconds - where the original one-line film-pitch made to the money-boys gets played-out ... but it's probably too little, too late"
17,28,0.82010347,0.14193498,0.03796144,1,What a complete and utter waste of money,"This is weird... I love Science Fiction and I love astrophysics, but disliked everything about this movie. The start was extremely slow and it was hard to stay awake. The second half of the movie was somewhat better but felt like a very cheap rip-off of Space 2001. The movie just didn't do it for me at all and the acting was average. I'm totally flabbergasted that the average rating stands at 9 out of 10. Maybe audiences have lost the notion of quality, story-line, plot, acting, and uniqueness - as this movie doesn't have any of it. Ah well, I guess I'll just have to wait for the next SF movie and hope it will be somewhat better, because I am deeply disappointed by Interstellar as I expected so much more from a movie with an estimated budget of $165 million."

One of my favorite movies of all time. I would give the first half of the movie an 11/10, just completely enjoyed it as a sci fi/ thriller(in the sense of so much always being on the line). I loved the acting and just yeah, a great movie and one you should go see if you never have"

It's not a simple movie, maybe that was already clear, is a Nolan's film.Matthew McConaughey does a great job by portraying Cooper. The most touching scenes are those between his character and Mackenzie Foy, who plays the younger version of Murph, Jessica Chastain character. Either it seems to be an ""Outer Space Film"" is more about human relations and how important is for us to be linked with others. Even it's a long movie, 169 minutes, I didn't felt it that long or tedious. The director managed to keep us engaged through the whole film. The experience on IMAX in 70mm film. The image quality perceived was superb, now I get why Christopher Nolan and other directors are fighting to keep film alive. I had the opportunity to watch it at the Chinese theatre and was a great experience, my first time in that theatre. The staff from the theatre even told us that Nolan himself watched several scenes of the movie in that theatre to ""calibrate"" the experience. Which is very cool. Well, I encourage you to go and watch Interstellar to see of you love or hate it."

Firstly a lot has been made of you needing a degree in quantum physics to understand the movie. Not so, the premise is exactly the same as his last move 'inception', time moves slower the deeper you go or in this case nearer the event horizon of a black-hole. Don't need to be a genius to understand that.Secondly a lot has been made of his revolutionary mixing of 'dazzling' science fiction and an intimate human story. As for the human story, it's clunky and at times cringe-worthy. It's dull and not particularly well handled with amateurish dialogue characteristic of the Nolan films. If you want to see a movie where the relationship between father and daughter is far better handled watch 'Contact'. As for the science fiction I'd have to say I was disappointed. Parts were very spectacular but I was not impressed by the planet scenes. Iceland yet again and a water planet with shallow seas and massive waves? I was somehow expecting more than this.Overall grossly over-rated by the critics yet go and see it all the same."

The movie moved into emotional elements of the characters without developing the characters. I felt nothing for the characters, and I REALLY wanted to. There were a few moments when I was interested enough to see how the makers were going to present some of the physics based elements, but nobody/nothing got spaghetta-fied (Neil DeGrasse Tyson's description/term).It is really a love story disguised as a sci-fi fantasy. And not even a very good love story. I was so bored, I fell asleep for about 15 minutes. I felt like just getting up and leaving so many times but I thought maybe if I stayed it would get better. It didn't. I really hoped that the actors starring in the movie could make it better. They tried but it didn't help. Can I get my money back? How many millions of people could they have fed for the money they wasted making this movie? They could make it up to me if they donated the money they made from this movie to feed the poor in this country."

As I left the theater I was not only spellbound, but I was also sulking about the fact that the movie had ended.The movie has a slow pace at the beginning, but not really boring. Steady and unique in its nature, I did feel that this movie might end up like last years blockbuster 'Gravity' starring Sandra Bullock and George Clooney. With every minute that passed, I could feel the importance of time, which let my prejudice drain away. With twists and turns, but not brain-spraining at all, it did make emotions come at par with adventure.Great acting by Matthew McConaughey did overshadow Anne Hathaway. With an epic storyline and Nolan's direction Space, Galaxy and the Universe did reach a whole new level.I would love to rate this movie 10 stars without a second thought because it reached the depth of my heart and left me speechless. This movie is not a movie which is meant to be wasted by watching it at your laptop or TV. It's buck worthy and a must watch for all the people who wait for some new serious, touching, heartwarming, adventurous, Science Fiction and Oscar deserving movies of all time.

Wouldn't it be much better if all this humanist approach was discarded in favor of a story based on the true adventure of traveling through a wormhole?If people want drama there are a huge number of other (much better) films.

I'm trying to find the right words to express the thrilling journey that is this film. First I'd like to advice you to try and pay attention to every single line - nothing is said without purpose and everything is somehow connected. It slowly builds up with the beginning to this phenomenal emotional ride and it will not let go until the very end. It will keep you on the edge of your sit - literally -, it will make you cry, it will make you jump, it will completely absorb you. Throughout the course of it I forgot I was in a cinema. I was living every single moment with the characters, feeling what they're feeling. At times, I found myself staring blankly trying to comprehend its complexity - How can this be? Is this really happening? Can it be so epic? The second time I saw it I understood the importance of every single scene and line, I saw more connection, more intricacy and (even) more genius in it. The first time it was grand and overwhelming, it just hit me hard and I couldn't really pay attention to details. The emotional journey part was very important to me; but of course, there are the stunning visuals which contribute immensely and transcend you there, into the action. They were fantastic, superb, simply put, film-making at its finest.This is all, of course, from my point of view - a super sci-fi, fantasy, adventure and all associated genres enthusiast. Although I cannot imagine how one, regardless of their movie preferences, can dislike ""Interstellar"" - it's that good.What I'm obviously saying is GO SEE THIS MOVIE. Expect epicness.

This movie is riddled with plot holes, a storyline that is so formulaic and predictable that it borders on something a 5th grader could have wrote. If you watch the first 20 minutes of the movie, the rest of the movie you will just be waiting for the stuff that you know will happen to happen. There is little room for surprise, and even less room for enjoyment.Adding to this, the visuals in the movie are a huge problem, in watching it I got a headache and motion sickness. So not only was I left with a feeling of wasted time after leaving the cinema, I also felt physically ill. I feel the actors in this movie are all outside their comfort zones, and the acting feels very forced, and it feels like not even the actors in the movie want to be a part of it. I would recommend this movie to anyone that enjoyed ""The Room"" with Tommy Wiseau, or Gigli with Ben Affleck and Jennifer Lopez.

Nolan finally shows clearly his hubris in that he thinks of himself as a cinematic mastermind, in fact he's just a Hollywood pet with cheap tricks. There is nothing wrong in getting the science incorrect, a competent filmmaker manages to work around the incoherence and still create a unified whole, Nolan on the other hand wants us to think that he understands the science behind Interstellar, but he also shows clearly that he doesn't put much trust in the audiences' intellect. This results in an over abundance of exposition which is there just to inform us of how stupid we are. The sentimentality, which is most of the time laughable, doesn't go along with the overall structure of the film because the plot is disorganized. The problem comes from the inability to transform a concept into a film without allowing the audience to interpret what they are seeing - instead Nolan tries to overwhelm us with his elitist vision and it comes out as a mess because he doesn't trust his audience, he's lack of vision doesn't come from him not having a concept but from the inability to mediate that concept through a film, in other words: he is a bad filmmaker."

I don't know how many times we're in a rocket ship blasting off somewhere with everything shaking, the cameras jiggling, the astronauts grimacing, and the sound track roaring, screeching, thundering, blasting the eardrums—I really did have to plug my ears by the end of the movie. Add to that the so- called music, which consisted mostly of even higher mountains of noise, mostly produced by a big pipe organ pumping out its gargantuan decibels in the form of a few simple chords—hardly music, merely a musical instrument adding to the overall accumulation of noise. I don't think anybody should be credited with creating ""music"" for this film.As for the stupidity, I was lured into the theatre by publicity claiming that the film had got the science right, or at least the graphic representation of a wormhole and black hole. Well, the graphics may have been right, but they were pretty standard stuff as far as eye candy goes, hardly worth the price of the ticket. What about the science? Maybe it was correct on every point, or on most points, or only on a few points—who knows? Only someone with degrees in quantum mechanics and astrophysics would be able to judge. For the general audience (obviously, the audience the film was aimed at), the science talk came across as sheer gobbledygook. There was no effort to explain the ideas for the public. The jargon was just spat out here and there with the purpose of raising a smokescreen for the current plot point. Very annoying.I wanted to enjoy this film. I hated not liking it, knowing how much money and effort went into making it. But by the time we got to the last 20 minutes or so, I'd had enough and had to fight the urge to walk out.

Technology and war are blamed for the current conditions. Apparently, because of some serious dust, crops are slowly being destroyed. Also, the dust presents health hazards. The solution is to find a way to get people to a new place...or...to let the chips fall and send a few into space to inhabit a new planet or asteroid or moon or whatever, and start the whole thing over. A group of people who have maintained NASA (which is now seen as the deceivers of mankind) are building ships to explore the possibilities. The problem has to do with a limited time to manage this because of the laws of relativity.

Joseph Cooper (Matthew McConaughey) is a former astronaut pilot who has turned to farming like everybody else. He and his daughter Murph find an underground NASA site run by Dr. John Brand (Michael Caine). Brand calculates that the blight will wipe out mankind in a generation. He is working on plans to save humanity after wormholes have been discovered leading to other worlds. Coop goes on a mission with Brand's daughter Dr. Amelia Brand (Anne Hathaway), Romilly and Doyle. However the mission runs into problems of relativity and sabotage. Meanwhile Murph (Jessica Chastain) grows up and tries to finish the calculations by Brand.I have problems with the setup to this movie. The idea that everybody needs to turn into farmers seems laughable. There are all kinds of problems with the start. The blight seems to be a catch-all for Nolan to use as a tool to explain away whatever he needs. It's inelegant and clunky. Apparently, science is not necessary anymore in this world. It's not like this dystopian world has run out of oil. A lot of it seems unlikely.Once McConaughey goes up into space, the movie gets better. It has touches of 2001 but generally, it is more like 2010. There are still some problems with unlikely human reactions. The whole conflict between Tom and Murph seems overblown. It's trying to up the drama without setting it up properly. I like McConaughey's side of the story. I would have preferred to stay mostly with him and lose some of Chastain's. I'm afraid the time relativity ideas may be lost on some of the audience. Even the best parts of the movie do have some nagging questions. It is still an awesome movie despite its problems.

'Interstellar' only delivers the bombastic silliness one would expect if a puffed-up Batman director thought he could eclipse Kubrick's '2001' with a puerile adventure story. Christopher Nolan's new film begins badly and steadily declines as its long-winded prologue introduces the stereotypical elements of a Steven Spielberg/Norman Rockwell Sci-Fi co-production - a widowed ex-astronaut farmer, his chiseled jaw, a feisty daughter, a crusty grandpa, a dying Earth, dust storms, paranormal activity, baseball, cornfields - and lots of corn.After about an hour - which seems like two - a valiant crew lifts off in search of a planet to save humanity. Once they've journeyed through an intergalactic wormhole, the implausibility dimension expands to cosmic levels. Scientific hocus-pocus is stirred into the sentimental sludge as gigantic tsunamis, deranged astronauts, spaceship chases, time travel tomfoolery and black hole baloney eventually lead to a schmaltzy Hallmark-style climax. The visual effects are above average, but far short of awesome. When all is said and done, the film's self-importance and mawkishness leave one rooting for humanity's extinction."

This is not a sci-fi movie, this is his is a family movie about a father's love for his children.I will not go into details to avoid spoilers, but there were about 10 minutes after the first slow hour that got me excited for the rest of the movie, but it was only a break and we were back to boredom and more crying by McConaughey.

It's 100% cliché-ridden from the git-go - the characters, the story, the actors (no acting is necessary!), the ""cinematography"" (almost non-existent) the music, the locations, the sets, even the editing. What an embarrassment, an insult. It's a film worthy of this year's midterm elections, as it cynically abandons all pretense and respect for imagination, experience, science, detail, creativity, or humor. It is written and plays to the lowest level of intelligence - the entire film does nothing but fulfill expectations set in the first few minutes. You might as well listen to the movie as a podcast.

Avoid the American version of Solaris. It's a travesty, though not quite as awful as Interstellar.

While Interstellar seems like classic Nolan, it also feels as if he wanted to focus on making the most realistic space film even if the story fell casualty. And it most certainly seems this way. Interstellar has the best effects that I've ever seen in a film. Each shot detailing the vacancy of space, and the planets that orbit gently is so well crafted that it almost makes you forget about the story flaws in the film. While that does remain as a huge advantage that this film has, it also doesn't delude the fact that there are some pretty glaring issues regarding Nolan's story and its characters. The story behind the film starts off as the unlikely hero is tasked with saving the planet...then it starts talking about space and the relation of time and space. While spoon feeding the audience isn't exactly Nolan's forte, it does begin to start sounding like a physics class in some scenes as characters spout off information as if it is supposed to be common knowledge. But, as Nolan intended, this is most definitely not your typical popcorn blockbuster. Interstellar demands multiple viewings and echoes early Stanley Kubrick in style and in pacing but one thing that has kept me from giving this film a higher rating is most definitely the characters. Christopher Nolan can certainly deliver us a GREAT film, his filmography speaks for itself, but Interstellar is one of his few films that features very little in the way of good characters. Matthew McConaughey and Anne Hathaway certainly delivered the goods here in regards to their performances, but their characters themselves were very flawed and not well rounded in the least. Their characters are there, strictly to progress the story when it begins to slow down and with a running time of nearly three hours, it certainly does drag in certain scenes. However, despite it feeling long and bloated, the imagery here is more than enough to captivate you. The technical aspects of this film are EXTRAORDINARY. Everything from the beautiful, flawless cinematography to the robust sound design, everything here is utterly flawless on a technical level. It makes for a truly engrossing theater experience, if nothing else. Overall, Interstellar feels like a film that is bound to divide audiences and while I didn't love the film outright, there's a lot to this film to admire and appreciate."

The gravity is ever present. Nothing ever floats about, and they get 'skipped' off the orbit around Mars before whizzing past Saturn (it has rings) and arriving at a black hole.

They enrich you, teach you, show you. This isn't one of those. Interstellar is the pathetic result of a lot of bad ideas slamming together in Nolan's mind, falling out as broken disjointed garbled mush in the script.The script isn't the only problem with all of it's hammy hokum and lack of character. Even the heralded special effects are so cliché at this point that they hardly add anything to this abyssal cavity of broken ideas. Here is what happened. Nolan saw some discovery channel show, or perhaps PBS, about the cosmos. He said to himself, ""I could make an adventure movie about that."" Unfortunately for those of us who recognize good cinema from average and just slop, he couldn't.I watch zero budget movies with more thoughtfulness than this two hundred million dollar nightmare. Trade me all of the special effects in the world for one moment of realistic human emotion.As cynical as it sounds, after seeing the 9 of 10 rating for this garbage, I question whether or not humanity would even deserve to be saved from the cataclysm."

Of course.Way too much time at the start of the movie setting up the ending, which came as no surprise whatsoever, thanks to the 'ghost'. And then we discover that 'love conquers all'. Including science. Of course.Probably most of the reason I rated this so low is because with a name like 'Interstellar' I was expecting way too much depth on the intricacies of theoretical interstellar travel, the time relativity concept, et al.

The most funny part was when he press the eject button in space. It does has some big star cast but the base story line crumbles beyond imagination.

Matthew deserves an Oscar for his role (no joke) and Hans Zimmer's soundtrack is a masterpiece in it's own right (completely new and different from his previous work, check the dark knight trilogy and inception).

I thought that maybe when they go in space things could get better... well, they did for a while but then the crew landed on the Ice covered planet and things got pretty sour.The idea of Cooper getting into the dimensional space and wrapping the story with the beginning was good but then again the end was OK and obviously left for a 2nd film.The sound was not good at all - I could barely hear and understand what they were saying, so maybe 50% of the films sound was a high pitched music overpowering the scenes.At the end I thought - this is a film for people who doesn't like sci- fi movies, don't believe in life in other planets and are narrow minded and believe only in conventional science.

It fits the movie so well that it was like the movie was made to fit the OST and not the other way around.

""Interstellar"" is his latest load of hooey, nearly three hours of sci-fi mumbo jumbo queasily married to a sentimental father/daughter drama. It goes on forever and includes all manner of tangents that a more concise writer or editor (anybody, please!) would have excised. Indeed, Nolan's biggest failing as a writer/director is that he can't seem to get his thoughts organized, and every movie he makes feels like a rough draft that no one ever got around to assembling into a coherent narrative. To give him credit, ""Interstellar"" isn't anywhere nearly as incoherent as ""The Prestige"" or ""Inception,"" and it's not as leadenly humorless and self-important as ""The Dark Knight,"" but it's just as exasperating as all of those other movies in its tendency to start with a good concept that it then buries under a heap of directorial self indulgence.I learned a long time ago to simply stop going to see Oliver Stone or Spike Lee movies when I realized that neither was ever going to make a good movie, and I guess I now have to add Nolan to that dubious list.Grade: C"

This movie was interminable; I almost walked out 38 minutes into the run, when Mathew was still just a former test pilot trapped in the body of a corn-huskin' farmer. Which leads me to my first problem with Interstellar: would you ""hire"" a corn-huskin' farmer and devoted Dad of 2 to be the pilot of an intergalactic space mission? Aside from 1 or 2 very brief allusions, there is ZERO explanation / justification for Matt to be selected for this mission. And strangely enough, Michael Caine ages not 1 day in the 23 years since Matt blasts off for ""strange new worlds"".He is still in the same pants and shirt as he was when Matt blasted off (23 years before); the directors did give Mike a wheelchair for good measure. Before I proceed, there were 2 or 3 somewhat interesting plot twists, and the CGI / special FX were very good (just like ""Gravity"", another recent ""sci-fi"" disappointment); although the robot was utterly ridiculous; more like a walkin', talking' 21st century soda machine or a ""Gen 12"" Robbie the Robot. Of course, CGI and special FX alone do not a classic ""sci-fi"" film make. I cannot disclose 2 major plot disappointments due to the ""spoiler"" clause but suffice it to say the powers behind this film have tried to fuse an entry level class in quantum physics with an action film; and it just didn't work. I have now accepted, grudgingly, that for enough money you can get the finest actors to play in the most ludicrous films. Read the cast list; scratch your heads in disbelief, along with me.

It has Matthew McConaughey and Anne Hathaway going to space and seeking possible livable planets for places to move the earth people when that planet becomes uninhabitable. Christopher Nolan directs quite a long but mostly intriguing tale of how long this journey lasts and the effect on McConaughey's offspring when they grow up without having him around during those times. I have to admit that part of me was ready to sleep during some scenes but something exciting does always come up and it gets a little better as the narrative keeps on going.

It raises an in-numerous questions even to the researchers who are the top in this domain, Is that possible? The answer is yes and no at the same time. For believers, it is possible as explains the paradoxes and decodes how it is possible and for non-believers, there are always questions that cant be answered.

I will agree with them for the most parts. It is a beautiful movie and it has a captivating storyline. Well, right up to the point where Cooper went into the Black hole. Then it just turned ludicrous.However, from the way I had been told about the story in ""Interstellar"" I had expected a bit more from it. I found it to be a bit too brisk in getting past most of the events that took place throughout the course of the movie.The effects in the movie were really good and came off as being believable, which really worked in favor of the movie, obviously. And the acting was also quite good, even with Matt Damon in it.There are some interesting elements in the storyline, I just wish that Nolan would have put more emphasis on the science and theoretical aspects of the movie's storyline; in regards of black holes, wormholes, relativity theory, etc.All in all, an enjoyable movie for sure, but for me it just wasn't as grand and epic as most people had made it out to be."

Great performances, incredible visual effects, an interesting story, and tons of really cool concepts, which make for a few genuinely powerful scenes, However, that doesn't make it the flawless masterpiece of cinematic genius everybody is labeling it as. There are tons of people giving this movie 10/10 ratings, leading to a user rating of 8.7, and it is now #29 on the IMDb top 250. WOW! That is a lot of praise! On the top 250, ""Interstellar"" is above ""Casablanca"", ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"", ""Psycho"", ""Apocalypse Now"", and ""CITIZEN KANE""! According to the users on IMDb, this movie's better than ""Citizen Kane"", which has been known as possibly the greatest film of all time!Is is better than ""Citizen Kane""? No, not even close. The film is full of flaws, the biggest being the runtime. I may never see this movie again because of how long it felt! It feels like a lot of scenes are unneeded, and were made just so the movie could be longer, because Christopher Nolan wanted to make it seem really epic. I'm sure if Nolan cut a huge chunk of the movie out, it would've been better. A film by Nolan that is better than this one is ""The Dark Knight"", which has a somewhat long runtime, but it feels way shorter than it's runtime, and is extremely entertaining throughout. ""Interstellar"" is so long that it starts to really drag on and, at times, I began to just zone out.The film is also a bit too dramatic. The dialogue about how ""love conquers all"" seemed very unnecessarily corny, as well as a few other select scenes in the movie. However, some sequences were quite powerful, especially the ending, which, actually, was kind of creepy. The concept of time was very prominent throughout the film, and it lead to some pretty creative and powerful sequences.Overall, the film is recommended, but you should be warned that this movie was LOOOOOOOONG!!!!!!"

A film of this scope and ambition is sure to have some narrative flaws here and there but it is beyond my ability to judge a film like this and find flaws in first viewing. May be i need to see it again to find any flaws, hell why should i find flaws while enjoyed it immensely. Performances were great. Hans Zimmer music was terrific and loud at times. Endurance docking and ghost subplot gave me chills. Some of the stuff is hard to understand like the Gravitational singularity, Relativity and 5 Dimensional space. But Nolan connected the dots between them very efficiently and mixed them with love and humanity. If you are a sucker for these things, the film will transcend you into it or else it feels overly sentimental. Don't miss it. I recommend you to watch it in IMAX if possible."

But the long scenes in space juxtaposed with the ugly scenes on earth were just too much for me to watch.

So I'm just saying: my review is based on the fact that i like space movies that forces us to think about whats out there.Its been 3 days since i watched interstellar and i still think about the amazing visuals, but most likely the storyline. The same as inception, this director creates a visual image that is so extremely close to my own imagination. But he actually puts it on a screen for me to enjoy? Thats just in word: unbelievable.This 3 hour journey takes you from a to z and it doesn't skip anything. Just when you think, they are probably not going to continue on this subject.. They do. You will get all your answers, in sometimes a difficult way.The lead actor shows a extreme amount of passion that really helps with the emotions on some points. I see this movie win more awards because its complete and i do not see that you should have shortened it, made it longer, have another interstellar or so on. Its done and its really good.I have to say that i noticed that a lot of people that review this movie expected things that they claimed was in the trailer or should have been in the movie. Like an alien race? I never got this from the trailer or any storyline. Also if you expect this movie to be fighting and alien wars i would understand you write a bad review, because this movie is not about that.Go to this movie with one simple thought: i have no idea what I'm about the see.

PRO: - Stunning visually, through and through - Good acting by the entire cast - Interesting concept - A strong second half - A somewhat satisfying ending - A few interesting twists - The main musical theme is amazing. CON: - It took too long for anything truly interesting to happen. It had a few good moments, but in general the whole first half of the movie was... a tiny bit boring. If it hadn't been a Nolan movie, I would probably have left in the break. I'm glad I didn't. But the first half makes me not want to see this movie again. - There are really too many plot holes. Or moments that are not well-explained enough for them to be plausible. Things like characters experiencing revelations based on... well, pretty much nothing. Especially near the end. Which doesn't take away from the awesomeness of the second half. But one has to overlook these things to enjoy the story. - Besides the main theme, most of the score seem misplaced. Too loud. Too bombastic. Or not adding to the emotions on screen. And I'm speaking as a huge Hans Zimmer fan here.All in all, I would recommend seeing it. Definitely.

I fell asleep once within the first hour and drifted in and out of consciousness throughout the film. It's too long, waaay to much dialogue - a completely bombastic storyline and Matthew just irritated me.I could give a much more well rounded review and get all academic - but its not worth it. I really can't sum up the words to say how much of a dull experience this was. There are some crazy visuals once they eventually get into space - but the dialogue and the actual audio mix is really lame.Watch it if you really have nothing else to do - or perhaps if you're a drug user it might work better under the influence.

Most of the dialogue consists of reams and reams of contrived quantum-physics babble, which, if you're like me, will whoosh straight over your head like those exposition sequences in CSI, with brief moments of levity provided by the two -weirdly cubic looking- robots TARS and CASE.Their journey to find another habitable planet is marred by a sequence of seemingly insurmountable problems that become progressively so ludicrous, it ends up impossible to take them seriously, albeit exciting to watch.We already have to stretch our disbelief past the opening premise that the world is dying because of crop blight, yet they've managed to build robots that have human intelligence and can adapt a variety of shapes to achieve a wide range of tasks. One wonders why humans at this level of technological advancement couldn't have found a solution to curbing this unexplained blight other than blasting off into a foreign galaxy to try and populate a mysterious planet neighboring a black hole.Glaring plot issues aside (and there are many), the film is at its best when in full space simulator mode and the audience is being catapulted into the roaring white light of a black hole, accompanied by Hans Zimmer's electrifying score (props to Zimmer for once NOT composing something that sounded exactly like Pirates of The Caribbean), making full use of the IMAX experience.Performances are fairly solid, in particular Jessica Chastain as the grown up Murph, and there is enough raw emotion on show to push some of the more logically questionable moments past your cynic meter and give a sense of weight and importance to what is happening, even if you can't quite understand it.Definitely worth watching on the big screen, but would I give it a 9/10? No way. This is a film that you will enjoy on face value, but once you leave the cinema you will start picking it to shreds. There are just too many inconsistencies, contrivances and blatant stupidity in the plot to call this a masterpiece, but I'd give it a solid 7 for blockbuster entertainment value."

Sadly I can't say the same about Insterstellar. I can't understand what happened with Nolan on this movie. The plot is a complete mess, filled with arbitrary nonsense they dare call science. It spends time explaining what a wormhole is and then it throws in some metaphysical bs about the fifth dimension which does not make any sense. This is not a sci-fi film it is a fantasy movie. The visuals are the only redeeming quality this movie has. But however great they are, they cannot save this mess of a movie.

It is a mystery to me, why some filmmakers love to mix so much ""science"" into their movies, when most of it is so horrendously unrealistic, misleading, incomprehensible and incorrect. Kubrick avoided most of the science talk, and created an artistic expression of the space-and-time mystery. That's why ""2001"" will remain a masterpiece and why ""Interstellar"" will be soon forgotten. And the movie is also painfully slow, 168 mins, most of which are spent on closeups of McConaugh and Hathaway, with or without space helmet as well as worn and rusty space equipment, as if that would make it look more real..."

Where 2001, Robert Zemeckis' Contact (which also cast Matthew McConaughey), and Alfonso Cuarón's Gravity used solid science as a launch for deeper philosophical musings, Interstellar begins with ersatz science and degenerates from there. The premise that a planet orbiting a black hole would be a suitable place to relocate Earth's population (after Earth's environmental collapse) is a fatal flaw. Black holes radiate powerful, deadly radiation, and everything circling around them are inevitably sucked closer and closer into the black hole's crushing gravity. Somehow, the hero (""Cooper"") gets himself inside the black hole unharmed, where he sees myriad display screens of himself at various times in his life. And somehow he sends his past self a message. The illogic of that circular logic (ignores first cause) breaks the entire arc of the storyline, such as it is.Then there are illogical subplots like the crew rescues an abandoned astronaut, ""Dr. Mann,"" from death and he repays them by trying to kill all of them for no expressed reason. The fight scene between Dr. Mann (Matt Damon) and Cooper (McConaughey) is intercut with something happening back on Earth (setting fire to a cornfield) that doesn't have any apparent connection. The sound balance raises sappy music, designed to portray emotions like heroism, way above the volume of the actors' voices. The audience can't hear much of what they are saying. I thought at first this was a flaw because I assumed that what they were saying would clarify some of the meaningless actions. But now I believe that it was just as it was supposed to be: gibberish.Although Nolan spent many, many millions, and some reviewers think this movie rates their highest number of stars, I say it is close, but not quite the Worst Movie of All Time. Giving it the title of Worst would confer too much attention to this sorry waste."

It's not a bad movie but it's not a great one either (which a 9 should be). It's creative in terms of story but it is drawn out. It goes for the Gravity look and feel, being slow, filmed in space and with dialog often replaced with music, but it does not have the suspense of Gravity. It's doesn't draw you in. It just doesn't have enough substance to carry it off. It has plenty of promise but lets you down in the end, especially once you pull all the pieces together to formulate what's going on.

Other than Christopher Nolan stalkers loving from afar, this movie is a 3 hour exercise in endurance. Once I start to watch a movie, even for all of the faults I may find, I typically watch to the end...only with Interstellar it just wouldn't end. It was torture. I'm a huge believer that sci-fi movies are fantasy, an escape from the every day, a time to allow the improbable to take over...but they still have to make sense. The disconnect from scientific theory in this movie is of epic proportions. For example, I couldn't get over the complete avoidance of event horizon as the film wrapped up. I found myself completely irritated by this because the film relied so much on general relativity to develop the story line, and then just bastardized the entire premise of the theory so that the main character could survive was a total rip off. The acting was so over the top it was, at times, comedic. The character development was so poor that, as an example, I have no idea what Topher Grace's role even was, I was just like, ""hey, Topher Grace is in this movie""? Given the fact that the viewer was offered the opportunity to visit a different GALAXY, it was a total snoozer to see that all that is out there is Waterworld, Iceland and the Grand Canyon.

If it happens to be my last as well, I wouldn't mind. This movie warrants a review.The night before seeing ""Interstellar"", I had watched Stanley Kubrick's ""2001: A Space Odyssey,"" which may have been the best movie of its decade/century as well. I was blown away by the beauty and grandeur of Kubrick's masterpiece, and I was worried that seeing it so soon before ""Interstellar"" would lead me to great disappointment in Nolan's film. Fortunately, this is NOT the case. ""Interstellar"" lived up to Kubrick's ""Odyssey"" and will be one of my favorite movies of all time. Nolan's movie certainly didn't surpass ""Odyssey""; the two occupy a very different space (no pun intended) in my mind and in the annals of cinema. I can say with confidence that the two of these movies have illustrated the glory of what can be achieved in a sci-fi film, and they cause all others to pale in comparison. Even the recently- released and acclaimed ""Gravity"" has no such weight compared to these two masterpieces (another great pun). Without spoiling any of the film, I would like to discuss some details that impressed me. The score is phenomenal, the acting is powerful, and the special effects are superb. But perhaps my favorite aspect of the movie are the apparent nods to Kubrick's ""Odyssey"" which made the dual-experience even more significant. Certain elements of the film reminded me of Kubrick's ""Jupiter and Beyond the Infinite"" sequence, the mysterious monoliths, even the legendary HAL-9000. Even with these slight similarities, so much of the movie was different, and in enough ways bolder, such that ""Interstellar"" feels incredibly fresh and original.Christopher Nolan co-wrote AND directed this film, which only further solidifies his status as one of the greatest directors of our generation. Even with his hard-to-match lineup of prior successes, this movie is a phenomenal standout. The run-time felt very appropriate, and just like ""Odyssey,"" I was pleased with how many things were addressed after what seemed like logical stopping points.Please treat yourself to a theater experience of ""Interstellar.""

It's too long, and way too much time is spent on explaining phenomenons that don't need to be explained. It could have been such an elegant and thought provoking movie, but instead it's dead set on explaining absolutely everything. It ruins the mystery, and the opportunity for me to use my own imagination. Unfortunately the time spent making sure that everyone in the audience understands the movie EXACTLY the way the director wants you to, is spent, at the expense of a good storyline and the development of believable characters and meaningful relationships.

An excuse to keep you in a room and play some space flight scenes. The film tried so much that ended up failing in everything. I think the problem is the blend of emotional crap with band-aid surrealistic physics that makes no sense just so that emotion could be the focus of this crap movie. I would really like to convey my opinion but this movie only left 2 brain cells properly working. It is that bad. I sincerely hope I make it. I have been drooling ever since I left the cinema.

Unsophisticated audiences may enjoy it if they don't analyze it too deeply. However, if you are one who understands the world of physics, aviation, or space travel, this one is hard to watch. There are a plethora of continuity issues as well as plot holes. It seems like Chris Nolan watched ""Gravity"" and decided he could make a really terrible film into something worth watching. He added the ""Contact"" premise and inserted some Physics theories and some expanded back story to create a mediocre film. I was hopeful that I would be impressed by the obviously inflated reviews but I wasn't. The guy next to me actually fell asleep during the first hour which was very grueling.

After an hour in I realised that I nearly nodded off twice as the music score playing over the beginning quarter of the film was sleep inducing to say the least. It didn't help that not one of the characters was engaging in anyway possible, especially Matthew McConaughey's drawling southern accent. It seem to take an age for anything to happen in the film, and finally when there was some movement, director Nolan slows everything back down to a snail's pace. I'm not saying the film was ridiculous as it is purely science fiction which I normally enjoy, but this was a challenge for me to stay till the end of the film ,-( two gents in the theatre walked out just over an hour in and never came back), I unfortunately didn't have the hindsight to do the same, otherwise I would have got over three hours of my life back to watch two good films.When the film is released on DVD/BR, I hope they have a cut that last's about 1hour and 20m which should make it an entertaining film without the huge unnecessary spongy filling."

The acting wasn't anything special, but the SCREENPLAY... It had to be among the worst three that I have ever sat through. In fact, I was close to walking out of it, had it not been for the laughing! In a sci-fi film like this, the expected reaction was far from the real one. Instead of a gripping, edge-of-your-seat effect, the screenplay and plot holes were so ridiculously bad, that myself and a few other cinema-goers were in stitches laughing! Like Prometheus (but somehow worse), this film had the adverse effect of inducing laughter in anybody who wasn't blinded by the interplanetary special effects. In almost all sci-fi films, there is an enormous twist in the plot or story that will strive to inspire a gasp in viewers. Some rare films have this effect with an excellently crafted twist... Not this time. The 'twist' in this film was, again, so extraordinarily awful, badly thought-out and far-fetched (don't get me wrong- these films have the right to go more far-fetched than any film has travelled before, but this one was just plain BAD), I had to shout out 'come ON!' when the credits began to roll (inspiring a few more laughs there from viewers in agreement). Even here, at at the end, there were still unanswered questions that were TO BE SOLVED at some point in the course of the film. With its mediocre acting, awful plot, vexingly atrocious 'twist', underdeveloped characters (entrusting a save-the-human-race mission to a semi-random trespasser - hellooo???) and boring disposition throughout, save your money and head to something - anything - else!"

Then, I learned that a well-known scientist(Kip Thorne) was attached to it as a technical consultant and my interest began to increase. Getting it right, scientifically, seldom works with the film industry, although there have been limited occasions where it has. Avatar, Kubrick's classic 2001 back in 1968, and one even further back, Forbidden Planet (1956) show that it can be done.With this in mind, I thought this might be one of those rare ones that could live up to my expectations. I mean, after all, Christopher Nolan and Thorne. How could it fail. I've always believed that, in order to make a quality science fiction film, you have to have a writer that knows what the genre is all about. In this case, there is not only the potential for quality writing from Nolan but also scientific expertise from one of the top scientist in the field - what could go wrong...go wrong.... Well, in spite of all that, it did just that.Yes, it was a visual treat that applied all the wonderful effects developed over the years. And it did that very well. But that's not enough anymore; at least not for me.What I experienced instead was story that was based on a premise that was faulty almost from the start with scientific shortcomings and implausible circumstances. And that's where the disappointment comes in for me. I can understand Nolan's possible lack of detailed knowledge of wormholes, time dilation, gravity effects, and the like, but how could a respected scientist like Thorne allow it? Unless of course he had little control over the film's production. Alas, that is probably the case.I'm not going into any detail about the the actual story because that is already well documented in other reviews. I end with a final summary and opinion: If you know little about that actual scientific aspects of the various theories touched upon in this film, you'll probably find it entertaining. If, on the other hand, you have sufficient knowledge of what we humans actually know of such things; you too, may be a bit disappointed."

It's not a bad film, but as sci-fi, it misses the target. A film about alien life forms is credible, because it's possible, but a film that mumbles abstract nonsense about a relationship between quantum data, time and five dimensions, that puts a primary character behind a bookcase to observe what's going on in front of the bookcase while unable to communicate through the books had me shaking my head. And then, in what seemed like an eternity later, in a silly and inconvenient way he does communicate. Also, I'm still wondering about the significance of the drone chase sequence. Particularly distracting was when HE rose from the pod. Maybe if I'd known he was in the movie would have prepared me for it, but it came across as an unintended joke. And the constant crying by every one of the characters was just too much. Reportedly costing $165 million to make, the money sure doesn't show up on the screen. For all the questionable raves about the effects, among other things, I wasn't wowed by them at all. A dark color palette full of dull grays was far from inspiring, as good science fiction should be and it came across on the screen as being low budget to me. Visually, it was no Oblivion. The relationships and drama between the characters is the main focus of the film with space and time travel serving only as a device to advance and put some quirkiness into that plot line. As I said, it's not a bad film. Without the lofty expectations of seeing top notch sci-fi from a great film maker, it still had some good dramatic and emotional moments that held my attention, largely because the actors threw their all into it and because Hans Zimmer's great score made some overly long sequences seem way more exciting that they were. Here's hoping Mr. Nolan gets back on track next time out."

There is enough material here for an epic sci-fi, a drama, a supernatural thriller, and an action movie. And that's a bit too much. There are too many plot lines and tonal shifts, and it doesn't help that the whole thing is way too confusing for anyone to comprehend what's going on.

That same ship can then take off and reach orbit from two alien worlds with out any boosters, including one planet so far down a gravity well that there is a time dilation of one hour to 7 years. At one point three ships are moving away from a black hole with no thrust but when the smaller ships separate from the larger one they immediately fall back into the black hole. There is a 300 foot ocean swell on a planet where the ocean is only 1 foot deep.It seems like every time the writers wanted to add some plot device into the story they added a new convenient constraint to their universe. For example you can communicate normally in one direction through their worm hole but only a few bits per day in the other direction.

There is some sound strong sci-fi along the way, but a lot of nonsense points have to be given too, though many are saved by the (almost) brilliantly consistent ending, and a lot of sci-fi themes are nicely incorporated and shown, to stimulate imagination in some capable kids.There is also a strong extra point given for respect of the father, as single fatherhood is vastly underappreciated in the wok esick culture of nowaday. The daughter ""scientist"" is celebrated despite of the fact that she entirely plagiarizes work of future generations transmitted by her daddy, which is taken as her modest denial in a culture desperate but unable to obtain wok ef reindly heroines of disciplines for which for many centuries including decades of ins ane positive dis krimination they are proven to be a bit too soft in the head for, a touche, if subtle punch that irritated the ""critics"".

The male cast is good, the adult female cast is awful, a small number of scenes are impressive, the so-called music reminisces of chalk on a blackboard, but all that doesn't matter because...YOU CAN'T HEAR ANYTHING WHEN PEOPLE TALK. Hum, sorry, I was saying that the sound department was run by either a deaf or retarded person. And so is Mr Nolan, who possibly didn't bother checking his final product. The thing that passes for music is that loud. Reading lips sometimes help, but half the talking is through radio anyway, so good luck with that.That's when I realise that Nolan can't actually tell a story through pictures. In many scenes, what is shown is severely shifted from what should be seen, and I would really need the dialogue to explain what is happening, but I can't decipher it because, you know, idiots at the helm. In the same vein, there are quite a lot of inconsistencies and silly concepts. And maybe the writer did come up with acceptable vocal explanations, but I'll never know, because a monkey spilled the background soundtrack all over the track I wanted to hear, and nobody cleaned it up.During the projection, I was seriously and increasingly getting angry at the technical lousiness. That's a first. Hollowood has reached new levels of incompetence.Save your time and money for something made by caring professionals."

A boring, inflated testimony to one's own overconfidence is Interstellar, a film that pretends to understand a lot, but in reality gets by without hope, empathy and realism. Neither the world that is going to end nor the new world, ie the world after ""salvation"", is a life-friendly environment and the same applies to the people who are supposed to find their way around it. Semireligious images underline here an unsupported science and do it no service in it. Instead, it is equated with beliefs. Human philosophy and values, closeness and affection find no place here. In addition, Nolan tells all of this in a pacing that makes you fall asleep. The dialogues are hollow and bony, but want to appear obsessively clever and ""deep"". The pictures have the need for biblical monumentality, but are annoying in their angles and tracking shots after the first 15 minutes. The characters are cold, incomprehensible and have religious martyrdom anchored in them - a disgusting affair. All in all, one can say that Interstellar is well suited for people who like to overestimate themselves and are almost sociopathically self-focused. Nolan can start there, because he is right that humanity is currently going its rigid and stubborn path in such a dystopian direction."

They present us with a conundrum and let us solve it -if it can be solved at all.This movie is the exact opposite of that. Nolan movies are not known for subtlety and restraint -and this one might be the loudest, biggest, and I'm afraid dumbest of them all. The movie grabs you by the throat and slap you in the face a million times, yelling ""we have serious problems here and this is the solution, and if there is a later twist I'll just give you a louder new solution, but don't you dare objecting to what you're given"". Even the supposedly intimate scenes feel like instructions: when we see Dr. Cooper crying over his daughter's cruel recorded message, we almost see a cue card in the background ""... and now, dear audience... cry!"".To worry about the future of mankind is absolutely valid. To make room for human emotions in scientific problems is even more valid.

There's not much to recommend it other than McConaughey's decent performance.Here's a few things that's wrong with this picture: the daughter is, to put it bluntly, a stuck-up bitch to her Dad: surely the most undeserving daughter in the entire universe of a reunion with a long-lost father. At least that's how she was portrayed.the premise is pure shlock daftness: it's a silly idea dreamt up as any old excuse for the journey. And I say this as a hard sci-fi fan (or rather, hard sci-fi taught me that the premise in a story was important).the effects are cheap-looking, even wobbly at some points! How on Earth 99% of viewers applaud the effects is truly lost on me. It just looks like a budget TV version of Lost In Space.there's a lot of crying...a lot. Cheesy as hell.the black character dies (obviously not a spoiler).there's some formulaic conflict later in the film which is just dumb and predictable. Don't expect high-end existentialist conflict ala Hal-9000 vs Dave Bowman.the moments of 'tension' are anything but. They're just boring and overlong. The music doesn't fit (sounds like a hyper-ventilating hysterical version of the brilliantly-understated Jonny Greenwood Soundtrack from There Will Be Blood).the other planets' visuals were dull, grey and utterly uninspired.the resolution was more soap opera than science fiction...and the obligatory wormhole/psychedelic sequence was soul-crushingly down-to-Earth. I felt the urge to leave the cinema early at least 3 times.It's not a 1/10 or 2/10, for those are reserved for the absolute worst film I'd consider rating (something like Pacific Rim or Sphere). But 5/10 is genuinely too kind, considering all the things wrong with it. For some perspective: I largely agree with the high scores of all the other films in the IMDb Top 20, and Nolan's last two Batmans are worth a 7/10 (Inception's an 8). Interstellar is just one of those films where I don't for the life of me understand the praise. Recommended for emotional girls with daddy issues."

I think Nolan could not decide between making a sci-fi movie and an emotional movie. He has given an average movie and because its a Nolan movie I have given it a 1star.

It attempted to blend ideas and plots from past Sci-Fi films, but in the end turned out to be a disconnected and poorly developed mess. Everything from the crap science to the uninteresting characters,cheesy and awkward dialog, to the story, or lack thereof made this film unwatchable. The characters did not come off like scientists; they didn't even come off like people in such dire situations would. Such as making jokes about being an asshole when confronted by a massive black hole. Anne Hathaway's character was particularly inferior. I seriously wanted someone to strangle her. Of course this could have been excused if the movie didn't take itself so serious or had some redeeming qualities/aspects.

READ THIS.!,"Yup Nolan did it again and this time he has taken his movie to another dimension.!!'Interstellar' is the story of a man trying to save his family and then saving humanity from extinction. Its full of space adventure and breath-taking actions on some of the most beautiful and unrealistic locations around the UNIVERSE. To realize Nolan's master-piece it Is better if polish our ideas about space-time theory. We know space is defined in 3 dimensions and Einstein in his theory of relativity uses Time as the 4th dimension. But Scientists in the movie realize that Gravity has the tendency to flow across all these 4 dimensions and thus Gravity is designated to be the Fifth Dimension. It is believed that whoever holds to understand and master the knowledge of this 5 dimensions will be able to move anywhere in Time and Space. In this movie a certain species referred as ""THEY"" has the knowledge of this five dimensions and it is THEM who wants Humans to save themselves.In the film various Scientific and Astronomical theories are used, and it will help if viewers have a brief idea about them too.Murphy's law- It is an adage or epigram that is typically stated as: Anything that can go wrong will go wrong. A statement relating possibilities with Certainty.Worm hole- It is a bridge, a hypothetical topological feature of space-time that would fundamentally be a shortcut through space-time. A wormhole is much like a tunnel with two ends, each in separate points in space-time. Though undiscovered, Some believe that wormhole could be used to travel through galaxies.Black hole- It is a region of space-time from which gravity prevents anything, including light, from escaping. The boundary of the region from which no escape is possible is called the event horizon. Inside the hole what happens is still a mystery, and that's where Nolan's creativity brings about.The movie is filled with unproved theories and unrealistic scenarios. But the way Nolan has directed it, you wont want to blink you eyes even for a moment. The graphics are, no doubt, marvelous. The cast did a stupendous job and . Though laws has been broken to keep the ending sweet, it is well deserved as LOVE has no rules and no dimensions.Conclusion: Watch it again and again.. and it gets better and better.!"

His films are getting increasingly more epic and complex but at the same time, predictable. I just feel I know exactly what I am going to get so don't have any inclination to watch his films.But, stuck for something to watch this weekend, we gave it a go.The last 20 minutes were a bit of an emotional roller coaster (despite what seemed like a few plot holes and inconsistencies, which I need to look into in case I just didn't get it). But it did not make up for the rest of the film, which I found not only boring but irritating.Most of the film I felt was unwatchable because Matthew McConaughey (an over-rated actor whom I don't like anyway) mumbles his way through the entire performance, meaning I had to turn the volume up high to hear what he was saying. However, there are frequent bursts of extremely loud music, far far louder than necessary and since the volume is up high to compensate for mumbling, it constantly suddenly gets too loud to comfortably watch. I had to sit through the whole film with the remote control at the ready, adjusting the volume up and down for the whole duration. When viewing the IMDb boards I can see this is a common problem and it has even been up for discussion in the newspapers. Now, whether Nolan intended this anomaly or not I don't care, it made the film irritating and difficult to watch.Apart from that, I found the whole thing dull. The characters were dull, the storyline was dull and I do not have the desire to watch this film ever again so it has no repeat-viewing value."

I can't fault the visuals, music or the majority of the acting - just the story, and in particular the turn it took at the end...what was that? why? there was no need! I was bored at the start. Then the film peaked my interest once they were in space and then the turn it took just made me fed up and annoyed. I don't seem to love Christopher Nolan as much as everyone else does, i enjoyed his earlier films and two of the Batman films but most of his films just end up boring me. It's disappointing because i usually always love his casting choices and i want to like his films but most of them just don't engage me. Maybe he just isn't for me. Jon enjoyed this more than me and gave it 7/10 but even he admitted that he didn't understand the majority of it and he also enlisted the help of the synopsis.

All we can grow is corn and you know what happened to Ireland when it tried monoculture: the potato famine. Earth's only hope is to send expeditions through a black hole/wormhole that's conveniently appeared near Saturn.In the movie 2001, the earth was poised on the brink of mutually assured nuclear destruction and a monolith appeared in the orbit of Jupiter so we sent a mission to it with a bunch of hibernating astronauts and an insane, homicidal computer. In ""Interstellar,"" the mission's hope is to find a habitable planet at the other end of the wormhole. To achieve this mission, a NASA gone underground sends the wobbliest, spindliest ship you might imagine with a bunch of hibernating astronauts and a very personable security robot.The space vehicle that's sent looks like it could easily be crushed in the tidal gravitational forces of a black hole. It takes an additional two hours for the movie to explore what happens on the other side of the black hole.The special effects and CGI are probably very good in this movie, but seeing it in Imax presented two problems. First, the focus was not very good when projecting the movie that large. Second, it's impossible to take in the entire screen.

Avoid this movie, it will bore you out of your mind and you will get pretty annoyed by category 2 people acting like you're category 1 just because you didn't like a movie that felt challenging to them, and because they can't fathom the possibility that some people are way past this kind of movies and can't just be impressed by it.In other words, this movie was just like Inception, mediocre.

In addition to Marx brother's physics (relativistic effects without relativistic velocity, 300m high tides on a planet with 20 cm of water), goofy space exploration (you land first and then, you start thinking about what kind of planet it is), the plot spirals into such a pile of nonsense that it is difficult not to feel insulted.Apparently, a good physicist was hired to provide the visuals for the black hole.

Tried to watch it another time on Netflix and couldn't get farther than 1 hour in before becoming bored out of my skull. Can I just say that I love me a good space themed movie. ""Moon"", ""Sunshine"", ""Passengers"", ""The Martian"". Hell, I can even get through Kubrik's ""2001: Space Odussey""! But Interstellar will definitely not be part of that list.Now after a close friend mentioned this as being one of their favorite films of all time, I literally FORCED myself to watch through it again and man... what a waste of time. (don't tell my friend that!)Here are my problems with Interstellar:
1) Starting with the acting. Either the actors suck, the direction sucks or the script sucks. Probably a little bit of each. The things these characters say and the way they behave just doesn't feel natural or realistic. So much corny dialogue! The characters do absolutely NOTHING to compel me or make feel anything any sense of attachment for them. Even the little girl character which was meant to tug at your heart strings does nothing for me. Don't even get me started on the robots. To be fair, the fact that I find Matthew McConaughey highly annoying, doesn't help. Come to think of it, what would have helped is if his and Matt Damon's roles would have been reversed. Matt Damon makes for a much more approachable and lovable figure, where as McConaughey has always been much more suited to be kind of a selfish bad guy.2) So many illogical points in the film that leave you wondering: WHY? I have a tolerance for a certain amount of holes in a film, but this just has too many to bear.3) When you want to watch a space themed movie, you're expecting to see some amazing visuals that transport you to another time and place. But even in this department, Interstellar doesn't really deliver. There are a few cool snippets, but for the most part, the movie leans very much on the dialogue between characters.If you enjoyed the films I mentioned before, you will most likely be just as disappointed as I was by Interstellar."

Of course, I was worried about the casting - McConaughey doesn't belong in an intelligent sci-fi, and Hathaway should only appear in movies doing a bad English accent in a lush period drama, but I was hoping for he best.SO we get McConaughey mumbling for literally the first hour, during the course of which almost nothing at all happens. It's so bad you have to turn the sound up. And then of course we meet Hathaway, who is to acting what Genghis Khan was to community relations. And then, implausibly, we see them sent up in a rocket to save the planet, which is followed by some nice visuals and ludicrous plotting before the end which is almost as bad as Bobby Ewing waking up in a shower. SO it was predictable, absurd, and poorly acted which leads to the question why are people falling over themselves to say how great it is? I suspect it's because McConaghey is the man of the moment, and Nolan considered a genius. Which people think mean they can do no wrong.Which is a disappointing conclusion to reach."

It attempts to say something profound, but the message is garbled. The movie attempts to mix jumbled pseudo-scientific dialogue with a melodramatic subplot involving a father and daughter, producing a muddled story with little dramatic power. The movie contains elements from 2001: A Space Odyssey and the Matrix, with its bombastic musical flourishes and the special effects meant to depict extra-dimensionality, all pure Hollywood. Matthew McConaughey is the principal actor; his character, Cooper, is the central figure of the story; the rest of the cast are supporting characters (their placement in the credits notwithstanding). McConaughey gives an interesting performance, which includes several scenes in which he weeps, which for a leading man is remarkable. The depiction of earth as a doomed planet is unconvincing and the plan to colonize other planets half-baked and one that tests the limits of plausibility. Being a science-fiction movie, stretching the boundaries of science for literary purposes is to be expected, but this movie asks the audience to accept certain premises that just do not make sense (e.g, acceleration of time; relationship of time to gravity; time as a material object). This movie is proof that when Hollywood attempts to deal with time warps, time holes, multi-dimensionality, relativity, and other complex scientific theories, the results can be less than optimum."

Also, the soundtrack was killing me throughout the whole movie. Too sad and without energy, not moving enough.

This is possible via a wormhole, of unknown origin. And it *has* to work.At its core, this is about the love between a father, Coop(McConaughey, an everyday man with vital experience and a good team leader), and his daughter, Murph(Chastain, independent and as stubborn as he is). This is simultaneously its greatest strength and weakness. Everything we are excited about rides, to some extent, on us, and them, caring about both of them, and what they share. Thus, we never stop caring, and it enhances all the thrilling space adventures(almost exclusively grounded in reality, and the best theories), where the mastery of movement(or relative stillness) of the camera and the volume of the soundtrack(and sometimes deafening silence) builds tension to its breaking point, and, crucially, never beyond it. And unfortunately, this emotional grounding does eventually lead to some sappy sentimentalism.The ending will divide audiences. This owes a great, and openly acknowledged, debt to Kubrick's 2001, but it isn't a mere tribute to that, and to exploration of the stars and what that can bring, the latter of which it seeks to encourage a return to. It goes different places, and the third act will be long debated, as it deserves. The humor is well-integrated, not distracting and it eases us out of what would otherwise be relentless and unbearable heaviness. All of the effects are amazing, and the technology compelling. Watch this in the theater, it is made very much for that, as far as the visual and audible experience. The 2 hour and 45 minute running time, and that's not counting the closing credits, will scare some off, and it is perhaps too long.There is some disturbing content and a little moderate language in this. I recommend it to everyone who doesn't outright hate Nolan it is very much one of his films, for better as well as worse, however, even with the hokey aspects, this is one you shouldn't miss. 8/10"

It gives you an idea what people are going trough.As the movie progresses it becomes clear that humans try to find a way to survive by exploring the universe and exploring black holes. With this extremely dangerous and interesting voyage, Interstaller delivers many emotions: Humanity, Love, desperation. This all with an understanding of the universe (it sounds a little vague, I know) It's hard to put to words. The extreme complexity of the universe shown in this movie really, REALLY makes you think. Though maybe the complexity of this movie might be hard to understand, I believe it's what makes it so great.This movie is a MasterpieceI didn't watch any trailers beforehand, and I advice not to read any information about it.

Matthew McCounaghey is fabulous, as always. The rest of the cast is under expectations. Michael Caine, C. Affleck, A. Hathaway, Jessica Chastain. Maybe it's not their fault: maybe it's just their characters, who are emptier than my pockets right now. I've a suggestion for all of yours dear readers: go watching Moon, avoid Interstellar.

If you had one year ago asked me ,personally, what is the most anticipated movie of 2014, the answer would be this film. About this film we did not know much, which says a lot about trailers that are now recorded as they have revealed almost the entire movie. In short, our planet Earth is dying and we can save it only through special mission that travels far into space. What is interesting is that the film is based on the theory of relativity and black holes and on film worked physicist Kip Thorne as a producer which gives a weight. The film lasts 169 minutes, which is practically three hours, but not a single minute was not boring. With this film Nolan did what Kubrick done with 2001 Odyssey 1968, he was ahead of his time. I know some will say that the problem is a big difference in technology and budget, but I find it incomparably. Clearly, there are numerous references to Odyssey during the movie and I was pleased when I saw the link, however, Nolan brings something new, something of his own and therefore I consider him a genius. Visually, the film is perfect. When watching it, then you do not see the CGI effects, you actually viewing space! Of course, in this film there is a turnover that perhaps many will not like but I am absolutely thrilled with a twist and the end of the film. It's very ambitious, I admit, it causes you to think and use our gray cells, but is it not that the goal of the film (or should be)? Why do we like movies? Why do we go to the cinemas? I am absolutely delighted with all aspects of the film, starting with the lead actor, story, visual effects, music, plot and ending.

I was amazed at how Nolan unwrapped one surprise after another and by the time the movie completed and end credits started to roll, I was left speechless for 10 minutes or so. Some of the audience started clapping when the movie endedsome just sat on their chairs dumbstruck! Outside, people were busy discussing the movie that they have just seenit is a rare sight! I was trying to analyse and understand what I just saw.I need to see it another two times at least to understand this amazing movie better! I need to understand the science the movie has spoken about before I can try to understand it! Nolan has gone a step beyond what we have expected out of him with this movie. I am amazed at how he can reinvent himself every time! Unlike other Nolan movies, this one is strong on emotions as well..at the core it is father - daughter relationship. We had seen only a glimpse of father -son relationship in 'Inception'this one could bring tears to your eyes seeing the performance of the actors. I don't like to give away much Some pointers by me..You need to brush up science and know at least the basics like time, black holes, relativity, gravity, etc to understand the science part of this movie.Do not spread spoilers on this movielet everyone go into the theater with no knowledge of this movie to be amazed like me!

For a movie which has a running theme of relativity and its effect on time the first point i should make is that its far too long. It feels like three movements joined together. The second of which will leave you checking your watch and pondering if you yourself are travelling beyond the speed of light and experiencing the slowdown of time. Visually its lovely, but the wonderful scenery doesn't make up for the often heavy scientific concepts that hold the story together. We are not talking Gravity level eye candy here but its still pretty nice. I also find it frustrating that in order to help us understand the difficult concepts, the characters feel the need to explain them to each other. One would think a team of hand picked experts for a super important mission that had been sat together in a tin can for years wouldn't have had to wait to the point of seeing a worm hole to have to explain its makeup to one another. Surly there is a better delivery method for hand holding? There is a bit of action in various parts which is genuinely suspenseful and enjoyable, but like space there are vast voids of emptiness. Lets break this down. This is not a movie for Joe Blogs. If cinematography and all that shtick is your bag, you'll probably dig it. If your looking for a bit of Sci-Fi escapism, this is not the new home your looking for......"

Acting as Matthew, Anne, Matt, Michael and Jessica simply rocked the screen. creating one of the most incredible joyful to watch motion picture for a long time.Chris gave back the inspiration factor to movies. he created an idea... a movie about Time... Love... Family... and future that makes you all the time wonder and think what could happened. And after leaving the theater you try to comprehend more of what happened... what it was about and I'm sure you will want to.Bring back Hans Zimmer again as from my option the most brilliant musician of all times to take you in with the music and ravel your emotions and at the end thrills you to watch what's next. this is only Hans and no one else.Visuals are brilliant, Imax is a total worth of a watch and the 160+ minutes are worth your time to get smacked once again by a new vision... a new inspiration."

I also would like to not that a vote of 9.5 is impossible for some reason and I think that is insane. People say all the time sci-fi is a hard genre and I disagree. The truth of the matter is space is a hard subject to make an interesting movie about.In this movie the only problem is if you have seen Gravity you at least got to look at a beautiful woman on the screen for quite some time. This movie (I have to be honest) Anne Hathaway does not look her best. Which makes sense because how can someone expect to look like a top model while spending so much time in space? Any who I had the pleasure in seeing this movie in 70mmm IMAX film and let me say I highly recommend it. I wish all theaters or at least all of the people wanting to see this film could see it in 70mm. I felt like it was the way the movie was intended on being viewed. Overall great movie for the fans of space. This movie is the dream of any kid that has ever dreamed of space.

He really wanted to make a head scratcher and this time with the laws of general relativity which the film does closely follow. Basically the emotional device here is that Matthew Mahogany traveling at a fraction of the speed of light through space makes him age slower than his kids and basically its a race against time.However the Nolan-isms come full circle with not-so-subtle foreshadowing, overly pretentious unnatural dialogue, heavy-handed symbolism, a really ear-ringing Hans Zimmer score which make the Inception horns sound like and an unnecessarily long run time.I can see that this is a script he didn't really have time to think through but you can see he tried and its still pretty entertaining.

When my husband and I hate a movie (as we did this one), we enjoy reading reviews by people who feel the same. I don't have the time or energy to write an essay about this movie, so this will be short. It is tedious beyond belief. While Nolan wrote and directed some movies that we loved (like the Batman series and Prestige), maybe it's time for him to give it a rest and get his creativity flowing again. I am shocked that currently this movie is number 23 of all movies. I guarantee that if the general population was voting on movies, this would definitely not be beating movies like Casa Blanca, Alien, ET and many others. This is a flawed system. The movie is so bad and seems like it will never end. I feel like I need therapy after watching this depressing bit of pablum. I didn't finish watching it, as I felt like I was being tortured. My husband did (because even if he hates something, he will finish it). I sat and endured it while I tried to read. I always felt that IMDb was the gold standard for checking on a movies worth, but lately it is so far off base it's ridiculous. I'm attributing that to cult followings of certain directors and in this case, pseudo intellectuals who felt this was some remarkable story. I don't think the critics will say a bad word about him after the Batman series. I think that at some point in the future, when this movie is shown on TV, it's star rating will go down a bit after all the hoopla has died down. I've seen that happen with other movies that were undeservedly praised. If you are looking for some wondrous story about space exploration, I urge you to look elsewhere."

I held myself away from such discussions, though, because I wanted to have an open mind when I watched it. My verdict: really well done movie that made absolutely no sense, in any number of dimensions. People said that it was inspiring; if it inspires anyone, that's good, but don't come crying to me when they come back disappointed that they cannot hear the symphonic music and the BWAAAAANG in space, like they expected it.I really don't want to spoil anything, so I will stop here. It took a mere 15 minutes for me to start gritting my teeth and it only became worse as time went by for the entire three hour length of this space sham. Prepare yourselves for Nolan's attempt at a Space Odyssey 2001, only with more special effects and no understanding of science whatsoever. It hits all the right emotional buttons and, indeed, if you have the intelligence of a dog, you will love this film at the level that they are so loving towards their masters.Matthew McConaughey is brilliant in his role, all the supporting actors are great, visual effects are good, even if unnecessarily over the top, all the little details are well taken care of... all except a script that makes any sense beyond ""Oh, love, boo hoo!"".Bottom line: my head hurts with angry disappointment.

I feel like Nolan achieved a modern 2001 - without being too much 2001, despite having some similarities. Saw it last night with a bunch of people in a German cinema on a big screen (non IMAX) and a very good sound system. This is a film made for the big screen and you really feel it, especially in the space sequences.This movie is visually astounding, with some visuals even being relevant for science, as they rendered the most scientific accurate black hole to date. The actors all did a fantastic job and you really feel they had a lot of fun acting in actual sets. Yes, the set design is brilliant. Especially the ""real"" spacecraft set.Christopher Nolan once again takes scientific theories, this time supported by the famous expert physicist Kip Thorne, explains them in his film's logic and plays with them in a creative way. We know this from Inception but this time his script includes more heart, more emotions. The plot is constantly thrilling and exciting, with some scenes taking my breath away. And of course there are typical Nolan twists one might not see coming before. The score by Hans Zimmer once again makes the great scenes even better. He just knows how to increase the tension of a scene with his sound. And when the cinema shakes and hums and pushes you in your seat, you know the sound design is perfect.This film really caught me personally. My heart was beating in the action sequences, I was blown away by the visuals, I unconsciously held my breath in the first scene in space, the climax really was rewarding and very creative. I enjoyed it a lot. I seriously don't understand why so many critics and audience had so many issues with it whereas many more international critics and communities say it is a masterpiece. The big gap between RT critics score and IMDb's worldwide audience score speaks for itself.For me, this is one of the best Sci-fi films of our time. 10/10"

He doesn't have the Talent of either but is a Good Filmmaker at times. He was 2 for 3 with the ""Batman Trilogy"", ""Memento"" (2000) was Unique, and has done some other Fine Films. Here, Not so Much.The Overt and Heavy Handed Sentimentality was better Restrained in ""Contact"" (1997). The unnecessarily Complicated and Thick Script reminds of ""Inception"" (2010). It tends to Confuse more than impress.It seems, when Matthew Mcconaughey asked the Director for Motivation He was told to Whisper and Mumble. The other Stars that Show up are OK if Nothing Special, although when Matt Damon wakes it Provides the Film with one of the better Pieces of Space-Drama.There are a few Good Lines...""Humanity was born on Earth but not meant to stay here."" and ""We used to look up at the sky and wonder at our place in the stars, now we just look down and worry about are place in the dirt."" But the Overwritten Science-Babble and Over-Complicated Plot seems to try and Impress those Viewers that Think that ""The 5th Dimension"" is a Singing Group.A few Interesting and Artistic Scenes that are Outstanding, like the ""Library"" are what makes the Film rise Above Mediocre. But there's a lot of Technological Stuff considering the Time Frame and Events that really are Strange and Bewildering. The Social behavior that got Humans to turn the Planet into a Dust-Bowl isn't Even Mentioned. Gravity, not the Movie, the other thing, is Mentioned Frequently. It's Worth a Watch but is mostly Disappointing and highly Derivative in both Style and Concept. Science-Fiction, Contrary to most Haters of this thing, does not have to Obey Current Knowledge.

The first group of scientists penetrated it a few years back, disappeared from contact but somehow sent a successful radio signal back to Earth indicating they found something magnificent which would be considered one of the greatest discoveries of all mankind. Send in the next group of scientists (better equipped and better technology) to find out more about what happened to the first group. (You could have built an entire movie around that worm-hole by itself.) As they come alongside the worm hole, conduct tests, send in probes, then eventually manned spacecraft. Once inside the worm-hole magically transports to another galaxy and in close proximity of a solar system similar to ours of which there are planets that can sustain life. They find a planet there like Earth. Alien beings (smart and intelligent) welcome them to their planet. They find their comrades there in good health and well being. They exchange technologies and are told that a whole plethora of wormholes are all over the place in space but they need to be ""opened"" by some sort of gravity means.

There is no way this can rate higher than Blade Runner (8.2), 2001 (8.3), Alien (8.5) or even Contact (7.4).Between the jarring jumps in the story and waste of footage, this movie struggled to hold my attention. Why did Cooper bring down a drone? What use are a drone's parts? If drone parts are so valuable, why not encourage kids to become engineers instead of farmers? Scenes like these generate more questions than answers. Why even grow corn when it is far easier and energy-efficient to grow algae in laboratories? What's more, it is easier to prevent diseases like blight in a lab. It's not like they are growing gourmet foods anyway. If a super advanced human/alien intelligence is helping the dust bowl humans, why place a wormhole near Jupiter? Why not near say Mars or the Moon? The movie never explains why the earth is so screwed that they could not go underground or underwater. Acid rain, Lava monsters? Heck, why not colonize Mars FFS? Why go to another Galaxy?

Nolan himself says in interviews that this is what he wanted -- really loud with dialog that's hard to hear. To make it ""more immersive"" apparently. But if I want immersive, I can go ride my pick of rides at an amusement park. What I want when I go to the theater is for the director to tell a story.

Hathaway proves here again she has a talent deeper than many of her roles have allowed her to display.I read one film critic's description of the film as being a not quite as good version of Kubrick's 2001 for his generation. But, I don't believe that 2001 has held up well over time, in large part because Kubrick's vision was so cold and sterile.

Instead, we demanded a refund and the Theatre Manager gave us passes for another movie.We both found the acting and dialog flat and somewhat clichÃ© and found the AI machine to be the most intriguing of the characters. I am shocked to see a fine cast fall flat due to the material given to work with. Nolan should have let the Actors Ad Lib.We were quite comfortable with missing the ending, which one member stated it was ""disappointing"" as well.The editing was horrible. How this movie did not have more scenes cut is mind boggling. As one reviewer mentioned: What was the purpose of the scene with the drone.The entire first hour, which told the story of the earth's problems creating the need to find a new home could have been condensed to just a few minutes. I realize it is important to develop the characters, but in this case there was only one member of the family going on the Outer Space Mission.We also found some of the special effects laughable since the Space Craft and Saturn looked like the miniature models that they obviously are.I am rating this movie 4 out of 10 and I sincerely feel that this is overly generous.Hopefully, Nolans' next movie will have better qualities since this motion picture was a disaster."

But even the emotional side of it was stronger than many movies that concentrate solely on this.What I liked the most about the movie was that everything looked like it could be happening in the near future. The spaceships didn't look like in Star Trek, but almost like the ones you currently see NASA launching. Same with the astronaut costumes, they just looked real.This movie really left marks on my soul. I can't stop thinking about it since I watched it and I am somewhat sad realizing that I may not be here when the human kind will really expand to other planets (hopefully long before Earth becomes inhabitable).Acting was flawless, picture was flawless, the depth of the movie was immense.

(Trump in space: America First - It's always advisable to squash the garbage if and when it falls into your path. Nolan brothers promised, as James Rocchi put it, ""outer-space majesty and deep-thought topics like some modern variation on Stanley Kubrick's ""2001: A Space Odyssey"". Interstellar, as absolute ""A"" production, is one of the worst films ever made by Hollywood ! It fails in every department, both science & fiction (fantasy) in ""SciFi"" are ridiculous, but that was never good enough reason for failure: many ""SciFi"" films failed in science- fiction but excelled as films in story telling, acting, plot, details, dialogues, etc. This one is so awful that I can't decide where to begin. If I could, most obvious starting point would be it's infantile plot and dialogues (love ""transcends the limits of time and space"", ),... no, it would be idea of faux all-American heroism, patriotism masked as faux concern for ""human race"", faux American superior technology, and mythological unshakable will to go forward in the face of ultimate, apocalyptic adversity - who is better suited for ""riding"" NASA's rocket through the ""wormhole"" so that he can save the world, then white-Christian farmer-engineer-pilot from Texas !? As David Edelstein writes, ""Nolan & his brother, Jonathan, clearly wants Interstellar to be a great American epic - The Grapes of Wrath II: The New Vintage"". Eh, the amount of pathos: patriotism, family, American mythology & heroics - I was, I am, all cowed ! Only great act of entire movie is Michael Caine's dying scene, but you have to try really hard to remove his Dylan Thomas reciting from your mind first. Ehhhh... Cooouuupeh, take us to the starsssssseh !

I had to literally force myself to sit through this one.Indeed this is a thought-provoking experience like many people claim. I was left wondering during the entire movie how such a lousy script could be seen as acceptable. What i really don't get is that if you are making a ""masterpiece"", and have millions upon millions to spend, how hard can it actually be to hire someone to write a decent script. At the very least a cohesive one.This is typical Hollywood form over substance. People claiming how clever and deeply philosophical this movie is are talking out of their @ss. This has the depth of a piece of cardboard. Sure it has some nice CGI, interesting science, good actors and director but a turd is still a turd no matter how much money you spend on polishing it.(minor spoiler ahead) The theme: ""Love is the one thing we're capable of perceiving that transcends time and space."" Give me a break. That's so cheesy... If it's all about love then how come later in the movie Cooper is only focused on seeing his needy daughter again and completely forgets/ignores his own son. That is so wrong... (end spoiler)Even the stellar cast can't save this movie from being a complete mess. All the big names underperformed because of the ridiculous script. The best example is Anne Hathaway. She looks so lost and out of place it almost becomes comedy. The best performance by far is given by TARS (a robot!). The other actors mumble their lines even more robotic than him.The very least you could expect from a ""masterpiece"" is that it entertains. It fails even that. For me it was a 3 hour long excruciating, depressing and boring journey through space that in the end was completely pointless to begin with.

With the heartbreak of having to leave his family. Will Cooper and his launch team succeed before it's too late? I'm sure the filmmakers did there homework on space travel, cause I don't think there just trying to make another sci-fi adventure, they wanted this to feel grounded in reality has possible. Christopher Nolan never ceases to amaze me as a director, with all his films so far, I'm hoping he never slips up. There are some nods to 2001 a Space Odyssey, but this really stands on its own. This effects are beyond incredible. And great performances by Matthew McConaughey, Anne Hathaway, Michael Caine, and Jessica Chastain."

You could discuss this movie in terms of its irrationality, its flawed physics, its attempts at explaining time travel and worm-holes (in a movie packed with plot-holes), its pseudo-scientific explanation of the 'existence' of love in humans, its overuse of the already overused 'Don't go gently into that good night' a poem both politically suspect and over-familiar to the point of banality. You could discuss it in terms of its stereotypical absence of mum and the struggling hero dad, its general bag-of-spanners story-telling ability throw stuff in and rattle it about. The fact it's a whole load of old twaddle told in a way that's an insult to the intelligence. But what really pisses me off is its stance on our environment. Early on Matthew McConaughey, our hero, the protagonist whom we follow throughout the movie, says: Mankind was born on Earth. It was never meant to die here. His intellectual mentor, Michael Caine, says: We're not meant to save the world. We're meant to leave it. THIS this let's screw up the world and then move on attitude what is destroying the world around us as we sit here is condoned, confirmed, seen as inevitable, advocated as the way to go. Let's find another planet. Settle there. Screw it up too. Move on again. Reactionary, Republican, right-wing manifest destiny across the universe. Yeah. Good one, Nolan."

But there: SPOILER,"This is the worst film I've seen since I can't even remember when. First of all, Anne Hathaway is enough to make any film make you question if the casting crew was on acid and makes Sandra Bullock look like a prodigy. At times you also question the evolution theory. OK, this was arguably ad hominem- Anne's speech about love, on the other hand, is taking things to the next level- it was like listening to a 12 yo Kardashian with a mental impairment trying to say something deep. The Galaxy, if anything (although probably equally as dumb) was visually impressive whereas this insult to your mind, vision and pocket was just plain WTF. Initially, I was glad to see that there would be no spectacular outer space battles which made me think that they would focus on the visual and/or scientific. But no. They so painfully failed at both that for the first time ever, even though I never leave the cinema, I just had to abandon the premises. I do understand that it's supposed to be sci-fi but that's the thing- sci-fi is a combination of science and fiction, not of bunch of misguiding cretinism and infinitely boring narrative. It's also amazing how someone can make a great film with Ben Affleck and someone fails to make one with Matthew McConaughey. Dylan Thomas is certainly turning in his grave. Oh, and so very convenient that nobody has aged while Matt Damon was out there- kind of defeats the storyline. Don't get me wrong, I am no stranger to bullshit films and on principle do not detest them, sometimes, even often enjoy them but this was potentially lethal. Save yourself the 17 quid, feed the poor, save the dolphins, stop Ebola, ANYTHING but don't waste it on this monstrosity."

I always enjoyed reading comments and interested in other people's opinions, but this time I feel I just saw a different movie than everybody. I feel that 8.6 mark (at the time of writing this) I highly exagerated in my opinion and I mostly see 10 marks on the first pages of reviews I read. I hate to be one of those people who criticize just for the sake of it, but I don't understand, I simply don't, how this movie, full of cliches and cheesy remarks, made especially for box office, gets so high marks. First of all, it just doesn't make any sense at all to me. In nearly three hours long (way too long for a movie anyway), every ten minutes characters switch their view, they say they finally know and understand the whole thing, the purpose, the way things are going, just to completely change their mind and view ten minutes after. And this is going on for the whole movie. Second, the cheesy talk and cliches of characters, classic jokes you see in each Hollywood movie, cool guy attitude of Matthew McConaughey, southern ""yee-haws"" that don't fit into a SF movie and, in general, situations that will NEVER arise in real life. I can pause the movie every line of dialogue and question a lot of things about why this and that and not this, because the whole scenario and script doesn't make sense. I am not a total moron, I am a college graduate, I like to believe I understand things, but this movie just doesn't make sense at all to me. Too many improbable and/or impossible things in it, too many ""cool"" smiles and smurks at the camera from the main characters and simply too many scenes that don't add put together. I could write against pretty much every scene, but that would take forever and English isn't my first languate, I apologize for any mistakes and/or errors in explaing myself.

But dressed in the trappings of science fiction, it's simply appalling.True, it does look purdy, with all that computer graphic stuff slathered all over the screen. And it does tell a story, of sorts: the dad who wants to redeem himself in the eyes of his daughter. It actually could have worked. But the story meanders for hours and hours, and any semblance of logic is completely abandoned after the trip through the wormhole, making it very hard to care what happens.Just one example: the takeoff from Earth requires a multi-stage rocket on the scale of the Saturn V. The takeoff from a planet ""near the black hole,"" (!) with ""gravity greater than Earth's"" is handled effortlessly by a tiny shuttlecraft. The movie is filled with similar lapses in basic logic. The final events near (and inside!) the black hole are so completely lacking in scientific plausibility that they'd seem embarrassing in a ten-cent comic book. In a multi-hundred-million-dollar epic, the complete disregard of all known science borders on criminal.On the positive side, Interstellar is a better film than Gravity. The science is equally implausible, but the story doesn't depend on the science quite so obviously. Nonetheless, the popularity of feeble junk like this makes a sad comment on the state of knowledge and tastes in our 21st-century society."

Many people get caught up in the plot holes and the scientific inaccuracies, and thus, let these factors detract from what would otherwise be an incredible cinematic experience. Interstellar is a film to completely surrender yourself to - and let the sheer grandiosity and emotionality move you. Forget logic, forget science. This is art in its most fantastical and overwhelming form. A father's heart breaks as he realizes he's broken his daughter's heart - He has left her and does not know when he'll return. Nolan pulls every string in our heart with the emotion of the father- daughter relationship set against the backdrop of interstellar travel to save the human race. Interstellar will, I feel, become more appreciated as time passes, and will, I hope, one day be regarded as one of the greatest films ever made."

I didn't walk out because I thought that the visuals may have helped, but two hours later I still had little idea of what was going on, and I didn't believe any of it anyway.I've given it 2 out of ten for the photography and special effects, which were amazing.

The science behind the film was also good, it dealt with relativity and concepts of time, space and gravity very well! And thats about the only good aspects there is! The acting, Chris Nolan stuck with a familiar cast, Hatheway & Caine from Dark Knight, John Lithgow then went with McConaughey to lead and Matt Damon, oh dear. I like all these actors! Lithgow was the only standout performer in this film, Im not sure McConaughey even knows what an astronaut is, he was so poor! Hatheway wasn't up to scratch either, the acting was poor overall. Don't even get me started on Matt Damon he was simply laughable how poor he was! Character development was poor & the McConaughey character down on his luck hero type is becoming very tiresome! The story, the concept of this film is brilliant, dying Earth lets save humanity, great lets get on with it then. At the end of the film I was still waiting for saving humanity to get started, so much potential and yet so very little story. Too many sub plots thrown together that never went anywhere, bad scripting and lines on a par with the Happening or the Core. This is is dreary bore fest, the guy next to me FELL ASLEEP, it was only 8pm! Some script was so poor that they have decided to play Zimmers music so loud over it that you cant hear the drivel that good actors are being asked to deliver. You could take 50 minutes of bad script out of this film and it would have been twice as good. The need for Matt Damon's character Dr ""Boring"" Mann in the film was just to make so long, IT doesn't add anything but time! Instead of a 2hr punchy mildly entertaining film, we get 3hrs of time wishing had fixed that leaky tap in the bathroom!

I gave 9/10 not a 10, because some of the plots I already realized half through the movie, and it is a really long movie.. but I really loved it, 3 hours were totally necessary and worth it.What I didn't really like, was that you couldn't see more of the earth, like they explain some things about what happened before, but they didn't show how all was left, or how many people had survive (maybe they mention it) but you just can't see it or realize, how many people were living or surviving at that time.Resume: awesome movie, would totally watch it again, just to see if I missed something important to make my own conclusion about the movie."
321,363,0.46564594,0.40691164,0.12744227,4,ludicrous story and too sentimental,"I give it a 5 only because it is an overly sentimental at times, ludicrous in its storyline, bloated sci-fi attempt at landing the Nolans some Oscars. A manipulative almost-dross. Chris Nolan is simply too ambitious for his own good. The comparisons with Kubrick's 2001: Space Odyssey are demeaning to Kubrick, they are not in the same league as film directors. Kubrick pandered to the intellect and treated viewers with respect, Nolan panders to the American Film Academy and the box office, and treats viewers with disrespect. Kubrick was a film artist, Nolan is a film craftsman and a businessman, nothing more. Interstellar contains too much talking, too much exposition. One astronaut explains to another the basics of how black holes work, like to a little child and just moments before they are to enter one? Pleeease. And what's with this father-daughter love and bond, crazy and all? The crying and weeping, she breaks into a crying fit more than 20 years later (kid you not) at the thought that daddy might have deceived her?? The underlining thesis of the film is that ""love is the only thing (a ""thing""??) which overcomes time and space"". Corny and retarded, and so very Hollywood. Emotional and family-oriented string-pulling is at the core of Hollywood filmmaking business, that's what makes them mega bucks, so they go on manipulating. Chris Nolan is either emotionally infantile or a manipulative hack, a film artist he is not. Basically the only element in the film that I liked very much was the music score, I found it very pleasing and strangely not overbearing, though there is a lot of it in almost every scene. Even the much-praised special effects and shots of the cosmos do not impress, for me there is not a single scene that gives a feeling of enormous vastness of space and how the Earth is but a tiny, little speck like a grain of sand on an ocean beach. I guess the film will be nominated at least for special effects and musical score, but it is far from a masterpiece."

There is so much we have yet to learn, so much we don't know, but we have the intelligence and ingenuity to find the answers, to experience the marvels, to solve the mysteries. The movie makes you think about how myopic our society is. In this movie, the world is doomed due to a lack of enough food. As a result, society changes from adventurers, explorers, engineers and visionaries, to a society just worrying about the ""dirt"" beneath our feet. Be ready for some complex ideas and just enjoy the emotional ride in this amazing movie! The character plot is thick, the characters are developed. There are scenes where time is morphed, and that will make you think about yourself in that situation. Matthew M. does a great job as the lead role. Go see this movie. Go look up at the stars.

First of all, the producers should have hired a diction coach for the actors, or they hired the wrong one. If you are going to have dialog, no matter how inconsequential or banal, at least have the actors deliver the lines without sounding like they have a mouth full of marbles. Second, why all the noise? Really, some of it was an overwhelming clatter that added nothing to the film, almost as annoying a cacophony as that in the film Armageddon, a movie I intensely disliked. Third, I do not understand all the hype about the great musical score for this film. What?! Again, like with the noise, the score was heavy-handed and way too loud. Sorry, but modern films that use methods and tools to excess to the point where the attention is drawn to the method or tool and away from the action fail to maintain the viewer's suspension of reality and consequently fail to entertain. The score should enhance the action and not compete with it. Obviously, current moviegoers don't mind having their emotions manipulated in such heavy-handed ways. Fourth, this film would have been much better with better character development and less melodrama. I wish this had been a better film and not a soap opera in space. And, fifth, some of the CGI was truly bad. I can't think of any film that used water in a convincing way. And this one failed at the CGI water scenes also. The editor must have known this, as the CGI water scenes were mercifully short.I refrain from describing examples in the film where the above five items are particularly evident, as anything I might say could be considered a plot spoiler."

For example, Prometheus was far better film as far as the sci fi genre goes.The plot for this film was somehow same to what I saw before in other types of these films. I could make a puzzle from different plots and make this one. It was all said and done before.Acting did not impress me either, somehow casting could of been better.

This movie shows you how to make a proper science fiction movie.It satisfies your curiosity about the meaning of ""infinity and beyond"". Nolan showed his magical talent, that he was not only making this huge ideas interpretable on two and half hours movie, but also to make us connect as a viewer with the movies. The Cooper family story is a one firm stand for the storyline. They made us felt something, the same as what Nolan wants to create in this movie, which is the meaning of hope for the human kind. The scene where Cooper cried when he watched his son's video,was very moving,and deserves an award winning. He was the right choice for this movie. Anne Hathaway, a stunning performance.She was into her character as a struggled Amelie. Mackenzie as little Murph awes me, she was like the gems in this movie. The other line up was very special. I could go on about all the actors but you should watch it yourself to know how amazing these actors are. Interstellar leaves you with lots of big question about our space, out there, a mystery that we eager to solve.It is about life after all. At first i think that this movie was very big , but to think again, the visualization of this movie was just very little compared to the real interstellar that was only God that knows all about it.It was a beautiful imaginations that made us realize that we are very small, and the fact that we enchanted so well by this movie, was a boomer for us that probably this is the only chances for us non NASA people to experience the best movie about outer space. Another thing, which is very spectacular and actually the key of this movie, is the music.They know when the right time to play the score, and when not to play the score at all-instead leaving us with this gripping silent that made you chill out of your nerves.It probably not going to be everyone's favourite, but i could assure you, this will be a new cinematic experience for everyone.An interstellar journey."

However, it is good to have a discussion with people about the movie to get a better understanding of it, because it will make you realize that the ideas were incredibly smart and therefore, resulting to be an awesome movie.I wasn't originally going to give this movie a 10, but after thorough discussion and reading the full plot synopsis, I got a better understanding of the film thus gave it a 10.

Don't be put off by the mildly boring trailer, it doesn't do it justice. There's definitely enough sci-fi geekness and action to keep me interested.It might not do great with the general movie goer, but I applaud Nolan for been brave and really delivering a great sci-fi adventure / drama movie. There are brave dialogue talking head scenes, which is rare to find in a big budget Hollywood movie.The action sequences were smartly done and the VFX was there to help the audience fully immerse in the story and environment, i really got the sense of adventure and wonder of space travel.The first and second act were great, the third act did felt a bit rushed and could have been a movie of its own. I suspect the original cut would have been around 4-5 hours.A second viewing would be great to catch the finer details as during some action scenes the soundtrack drowned out the dialogue.I would compare this movie to ""Frequency"", ""Contact"", ""Signs"", ""Gravity"", With hints of ""2001 space odyssey"", ""Prometheus"", ""Oblivion""A good movie to see with fellow geeks and one of the most interesting movies i've watched this year."

Whereas most people are able to send words flying from their maw Matthew just lets them slither from his lips whereupon they plummet to the floor and their meaning is lost the audience. So prepare to spend your time with this film constantly twiddling the volume so you have a chance of catching the dialogue.... So the film itself? About as exciting as a brisk walk around an industrial estate. Painfully slow to start and once it does finally begin it generates pretty much a single spot of excitement before becoming desperately dull again. The science as well as most of the social interactions within this film are full of plot holes which I'll spare you due to the spoilers but if you think about the film after watching it a lot of it doesn't really make any sense. The climax of the film is somewhat boring combined with fanciful and a painfully tiring family tie in. No idea why everyone else thought this film was any good. I thought it was drivel.

The story is thin.....I can't blame the actors, the entire plot is pretty simple. Can't inhabit earth, find somewhere else to live. Interstellar is a repeat of time continuum stories you have heard or seen before, I wont spoil it, but it's all been told before. Dialog is dreary, slow, ponderous. The comparison to 2001 is preposterous. The wonder and awe of 2001 and other movies before it was it had never been done it was the first. 2001 was all done without the advanced technology we have in computer imagery we have today. 2001 was a pioneering effort. This is not at all pioneering, inventive or surprising if you read science fiction at all. The imagery is not all that unique or impressive. The constant thumping and droning of background music was mind numbing. Most of the show I was trying to nod off, but for the LOUD THEATER ORGAN playing in the background I probably would have. I have to agree with some of the reviewers who thought the whole show was ridiculous and in some ways they are right. Somehow science has advanced enough to create interstellar space travel but not far enough to build power cells, clean power, they are still burning fossil fuels. The robots are Lego like, silly looking clunks of stainless steel....it is all so ridiculous. I would not call this HORRIBLE or AWFUL I have seen some real stinkers over the years.

Christopher Nolan has shaped a movie that tackles some fairly complex astrophysical issues, and carried it off with aplomb.Fantastic special effects, a clever plot and decent performances by an all-star cast.Not perfect though. The sci fi parts are great but the relationship / human drama stuff seems clumsy at times. The scene setting at the beginning seems to take forever. We all know the really good stuff - the space scenes - are coming at some stage but Nolan draws out the more mundane earth stuff. Plus, there are scenes and plot detours which feel unnecessary, and periods where the movie seems to drift. The Matt Damon sub-plot just felt like padding. Some of the seemingly unnecessary, overly contrived or implausible things do ultimately have a purpose.

The art of story telling with camera has certainly been personified to its zenith by Mr. Nolan. Keeping Physics as the pivotal ingredient. Movies like Interstellar needs to be watched time and again.

I had been keeping up on this movie's development since a year ago. I like Christopher Nolan's movies, even though I always feel like his plots tend to squander some brilliant ideas. The best example was Inception - he could have done so much more with that brilliant premise for a movie. He sort of did it again with Interstellar, there was an opportunity to do much more, but the end product was a highly impressive movie that I really enjoyed. Seeing the visuals of this movie in an IMAX theater is enough enjoyment for the ticket price. But Nolan managed to make the plot worth following as well. He took the plot in a direction that I wasn't crazy about, but I can't really talk about it because it would become a spoiler. I kept thinking during the movie - ""If Nolan would have done this, or taken the movie this way it would have been so much better..."" the same way I said it to myself during Inception. I ended up not being impressed by Inception, but this movie was different. His way was pretty darn good. There were several scenes that had me literally on the edge of my seat. Great suspense. I had a preexisting hatred of Anne Hathaway's acting, but she was actually pretty good in this. She played her part perfectly. I've always been a fan of Wes Bentley and I hope to see him take on some bigger roles now that he's back and recovered from drug abuse. And I don't get why so many people don't like Matthew McConaughey, but he is on some kind of a roll lately with his movies. He was superb in this one, very believable both as an astronaut and as a caring father. I really think he's going to win another Best Actor for this, he was that good. We need more great, serious space exploration / sci-fi films, and this is a terrific start. I really liked the effort by Nolan to make this movie seem real. You could tell that they spent a lot of time with Kip Thorne and incorporated his ideas very well. I know that it's far fetched, but I would really like to see a sequel to this movie. As great a job as Nolan did, I'm already anxious to see more. I think he could do it and I think that with the story he built, it could be even better."

Hence, I will refrain from explaining the story-line and rather jump directly into the review itself.Christopher Nolan's tenth work on screen and his first work off earth is as big as the journey (taken by the crew in the movie) itself.That is only if you agree that $165,000,000 (the movie's budget) is actually a huge dough. Just like Necessity is the mother of Invention, Imagination is the power of Cinema. But there are many fellow movie-buffs who felt that Nolan had taken it too far under the cloak of imagination.When the question of whether all we see is possible arises, the answer comes from the McConaughey himself , ""It is not Possible, but it is necessary"". Now go back to the beginning of this para and read the quote (to understand the pun). I am from India, where we have our own flourishing movie industry and our moviegoers are second to one. In taste of good cinema we treat Hollywood as one of our one but it has been too long since I hear applause from the crowd once the credits started rolling. Now if it was FDFS, I wouldn't be surprised. But I watched it a good 3-4 days after its scheduled India release which tells us a lot about the way the common moviegoer perceived the movie. Applause may have stemmed from the Hope that was injected at the end or the brilliance of Nolan, I leave that your better judgement.My only grunt was that Einstein wasn't hear to see this venture. For it was he who wrote the ABCs on which the movie's foundation was laid.The character that impressed me the most, others may not feel the same way, was Dr.Mann. It wasn't Matt Damon's performance but the way it was penned that added grace and Drama to the story. It has proved that typical Human Survival instinct takes front seat no matter how far from earth we are. Before we start judging Dr.Mann (those who have watched the movie), we should ask ourselves the same question, ""Would I have done the same?""The cast has done its role, but let's be frank, they won't get Oscars for their performance. But they can settle down with a satisfying performance and for many in the crew, working with Nolan, is one off the bucket list.Interstellar: Stellar Indeed."

So when his name popped up when the movie ended I had a moment of ""That explains everything!"" The premise is not new, but the delivery sure is... Earth is dying. Some kind of vegetation plague is killing our planet's crops, the dirt is turning against us, and mankind has ceased warfare, frivolous money spending, and hunkered down to focus on agriculture. Former NASA Pilot, Cooper, works on a farm with his two kids and father in law. His daughter begins discovering things happening in her bedroom that will soon change everything. The film itself is gripping and although the prologue is focused on getting to know the characters and introducing us to the world as it is in this fictional future, albeit slowly, you don't have to wait very long until it starts to get into the trademark Christopher Nolan intensity that grabs you, throws you around, excites you, and doesn't let go until the end. There aren't really any of his films this could compare in any way to, it's so different and fresh. It's feel could be compared to Inception, but that's it. The acting is beyond great, and McConaughey and Hathaway work very well together on the screen. The visuals, effects, editing, and sound are all superb. There is a lot of big, grandiose shots in the film, so it would be beneficial to see this in the theater at least once to get the full effect. This movie really was made to be on the big screen.It's not often I think of a movie as one that will go down in history, but this certainly will. It's presentation, plot, and approach put it up there with classics like 2001: A Space Odyssey, which many times you can tell was one of the main inspirations for this film. The banks and corners Nolan takes in this movie will get your heart pumping, and the acting and effects will visually hold you.

The picture and effects were very well done. Classy but not over the top unbelievable. I liked the cast and enjoyed their performances. The movie was a bit metaphysical at some points but it wasn't beyond all belief. You do have to allow a minor bit of flexibility in your state of reality to truly enjoy this one. But that's what SciFi is all about. A bit of futuristic thinking is required. I watch this one with my 12yo son and he was transfixed all the way through. And very animated after the movie ended. We both enjoyed it. Reminded me a lot of the ""Odyssey"" movies. I've read a lot of the lesser reviews and I can say those reviewers seem rigid and inflexible and unforgiving of a lot of aspects in the movie that don't really stand out as flaws IMO.

The beauty of the love relationship between Cooper and Murph, despite the unimaginable, possibly uncountable distance between the two souls proved that our emotions, our love, truly can transcend time and space; that no matter how far be that special someone be, in terms of distance or time, they will always matter to our hearts, kept close, warm against the cold backdrop of existence.Time has been introduced now, not just an existence to sentient beings, but also a currency that played part in consequences beyond our perception. I loved the way how Nolan narrated his story using this as the essence of his plot.Make no doubt. This is a great film, albeit not Nolan's best. At times, the film felt extremely draggy and the audiences actually get detached from the story itself, but what comes next will suck everyone back into its emotional sci-fi narration.This movie isn't without its flaws, but it dares to reach out to the stars, far, far beyond what other Hollywood directors can ever dream off when they look up into the night. What else could be said?"

As sci-fi movies fan, this movie gotta tops them all (No exaggerating). Even though it's a long movie but the acting and the script all along with the music effects keeps you engaged with the movie from the begging till the end. The storyline is amazing full of suspense and keeps your brain on full concentration. The movie starts slow to be honest but it gives you some hints here and there about the next big thing that will happen. As the story line begins to develop, you can't take your eyes off the screen , every scene hides a message that later on helps you to fully understand the Movie. Of course the leading character (Matthew McConaughey) did a great job, some scenes were so emotional that I couldn't resist my tears. Overall it's a great movie full of love, adventure and suspense. If you haven't watched it yet then what are you waiting for ? Totally deserves a 10/10"

What matters is, this movie, though it is a sci-fi movie, is a movie about love. Its up there with Space Odyssey 2001 and Solaris (the original, not the remake). Its a Sci-fi movie that made me wipe my eyes. This is a true Nolan movie so there are unexpected plot twists and physics explanations that is confusing at times. They did hire theoretical physicist to make this movie and sci-fi events are based on his theories. For non physicists, just take things at face value and enjoy the movie. For those who are expecting this movie to be similar to: Armageddon, Transformers, Edge of Tomorrow, etc, you will be very much disappointed. Its not that kind of a sci-fi movie. Its more of a Cloud Atlas (not only because its almost 3 hours long) sci-fi than Guardians of the Galaxy action pack mindless entertainment. I am sure this movie will make it to top 20 movies on IMDb, despite a large portion of people who will hate it, because they expected to see something similar to Startrek, and didn't count on this movie to be so sentimental and didn't bring tissues."

I want the people I love to survive, and their descendants, and (at a push) all flesh-and-blood people, but I don't give two hoots about the human race in the abstract.

Of course the father is an all-American hero whose daughter grows up to be a brilliant scientist. However, he has to leave her behind, so that later, with her help, he can save mankind.

Spielberg, whose main weakness is simplicity of human emotion and stubborn inability to explore the gray areas of the human condition, is both a great technician and has a strong grasp of film making essentials, such as pacing/character development/connecting with the audience/communicating his vision...Nolan generally lacks in all these skills. He's a great craftsman, but he has no idea what the hell his own film is about. There's no vision in this film. No perspective. No character development. No connection with the audience. The pacing is bordering on amateurish; he speeds up when he should be slowing down, and slows down when he should be increasing the pace or maintaining the pace.These film making nuances fly over Nolan's silly, endlessly pretentious head.He thinks putting in a ludicrous, nonsensical and blatantly pseudo-scientific twist at the end will save this schlock from mediocrity.It doesn't. I found myself sighing and rolling my eyes and shaking my head.This film, when all is said and done, is another missed opportunity to create something truly inspiring; epic even.This was not a film to give to a master craftsman. It's a shame Spielberg passed this on, because in more capable hands this could have been a masterpiece.Instead, it's just a technically proficient hollow shell of a movie that has already been forgotten by most.This will not become the classic that Nolan dreamed it would. 2001: A Space Odyssey this is not.Not even close."

They are infinitely more entertaining and closer to reality without making paradoxes left and right. Or heck even Solaris if you're really that into melodrama.

Kubrick was derided as being to coldly cerebral (by the hilarious Pauline Kael) so his opus with Arthur C. Clarke was a powerful - philosophical - ellipse about mankind. Interstellar is a dumbed down version where humans do get to express their feelings and AI have a humour parameter.I liked the futuristic vision of Earth, it was great to see something different, in between post-doomsday and pure phantasmagoria. Now the way to connect a brilliant pilot (simply the best) stuck in the dust to the plan to go interstellar was just a gigantic leap of faith for anyone invoking suspension of disbelief. Not that it stroke me violently as such during the show but you are waiting for the Man to fly to the stars and when you see how they managed to transition to this part you do feel this is cheap.Then Interstellar moves forth with lots of boring exposition about why, when, what if... that is all supposed to give us a scientific and credible background. This is simply not very good. Then we get to watch the movie we came for as they reach for the Stars Gate near Saturn (2001), simply called a worm-hole. Most of what follows suffers from the same sin of too much rational exposition in between irrational action by top skilled characters.In the end you are just a passive viewer not knowing if the whole movie added anything to the genre or just mixed pompous mankind stakes with routine Hollywood melodrama. With Solaris Tarkovski already had his own answer to the lack of human feeling in 2001, which Soderbergh remade. Anything less subtle about human feelings for an astronaut is trash. Nobody goes to watch a movie about The Future of Mankind and Serious Space Exploration while only expecting characters to be as emotionally unstable as in a soap opera."

They were joined together by scenes that better fit an SF movie of B provenance.

I never thought of Matthew McConaughey as a real actor, but in this film he does a wonderful job, no one can play the idiotic role of the genius farmer as he does, dramatically suffering just as Nolan directed him, any other actor would have burst in a crazed laughter at the idiotic script, but Matthew, a ""thinking actor"" did exactly what was expected from him. must respect him for that. few words about the music, there were all the right notes and volume to make this flick seem like a ""serious"" one. but the music itself was created on a very cheap emotional theme.

The man is capable of unique vision, of scope that comes across only every once in a while. Such as seen in Inception and The Dark Knight. But this? This is still a good movie, but that's all. It's not great, mainly because of limitations in storytelling, dialogue and style.The biggest problem is that Nolan's faults shine through more than usual. His over-reliance on exposition dialogue, his longwindedness and tendency to linger too long in certain scenes. In most of his movies you get the sense that he had one idea too many. Well, in this he had easily two or three ideas too many. This could have been a two hour movie, without a doubt, and it would have been better for it.It also seems to have problems deciding what it's trying to be. Is it a hard scifi epic along the lines of 2001: A Space Odyssey, or something more leaning towards drama and so called space opera. Certain scenes lean more towards the former, some towards latter, and they don't mesh at all.That being said, it's a fine movie. First of all, it's absolutely gorgeous. I have slight problems with the designs of the actual planets, but every single shot of space is jaw-dropping. I also like that they went and paid actual scientists to figure out what a black hole might look like, among other things. That shows dedication and certainly makes for a very memorable visual.The cast is also superb. The problems with the characters stem from the script, not the actors, and all of them have great chemistry together. One of the underlying themes in this movie is the relationship between father and daughter. Both Matthew McConaughey and Mackenzie Foy, as well as Michael Caine and Anne Hathaway make for a great pair and I have no complaints about their performances.Alas, I just cannot call Interstellar a great film. The ending alone would ruin it for me, but the whole journey is so needlessly long and slow that I never got into it. The movie has a lot of good ideas - the dying Earth, the robots, the black hole's affect on space-time - but those ideas are poorly realized and the whole just isn't as good as Nolan's previous work. It's worth watching, certainly, and it's not a bad film, not at all. Just a deeply flawed one."

It has that kind of look and feel to it.With a stellar cast that includes John Lithgow, Michael Caine, Matt Damon, Casey Affleck, and Jessica Chastain, and with Christopher Nolan's magnificent direction, Interstellar shines like a supernova in the pantheon of cinema. This is hands-down Nolan's best work, and his previous films (The Dark Knight trilogy; Inception; The Prestige; Memento) were a mighty tough act to follow. If I didn't know better, I'd swear Nolan was channeling Stanley Kubrick.An accident on the Endurance threatens to maroon Cooper and Dr. Brand (Anne Hathaway). In a heart-stopping maneuver reminiscent of a harrowing scene from Gravity, Cooper saves the day with brilliant piloting. I guarantee you that this scene will have you sitting on the edge of your seat for what seems like eternity.There are other moments of enormous excitement and action, for example, a shuttlecraft trying to escape a mountain-size ocean swell, or the Endurance trying to free itself from the death grip of a huge black hole. There are also moments of monumental betrayal, of unforgivable lies. And moments of love and sorrow. Underlying the entire film is a profound story of love and faith.Wormholes, black holes, event horizons, gravitational waves, multiple dimensions, tesseracts, O'Neill cylinders. If these things excite you (and they should!), you've got to see this film. Buckle up, it's one helluva ride!!!"

Just appreciate the beauty of the very meticulous work Nolan has done.I won't deny there are some plot holes, but name one movie which doesn't (except godfather perhaps).

Go and do some research on what theories and concepts Nolan used in the film. Idiots who call this a stupid movie have completely failed to grasp the basic essence of the movie. Yes. there are some plot holes, but overtaken by the grandiosity of basic concept.Some of the scenes were so epic...so strong. this is probably Nolan's most ambitious effort to date (i think TDK and memento were his best).

I'm not going to go into the details of the plot etc. Just let me say, it was a stunning film with amazing cinematography, brilliant acting (especially from Matthew McConaughey), expertly directed and a score to die for. I can't comment on the physics, because I'm no scientist, but considering the calibre of those who worked on the film and of those who have backed him after seeing the film, I'd rather take their word than a few reviewers here whose actual scientific qualifications I have no evidence of. In any event, I watch a movie to be entertained, enthralled and delighted, not to take every opportunity to pick holes in every aspect of the story. If I wanted absolute verifiable science, I'd go to a physics lecture in college. Where actually most astro-physicists worth their salt would admit that very little about the subject matter here has been verifiably proved.This film entertained, enthralled and delighted me and I can't wait to see it again."

The story was rich with emotions, action, and excitement as Matthew McConaughey gives us an Oscar-worthy display of acting. The special effects were absolutely wonderful and the amazing audio that Hans Zimmer provided only added to the movie's top-tier development. I've seen the movie multiple times and in each of those fully-packed theatre moments I was in, people stood up clapping and cheering and then left with the largest smiles on their faces (which achieved the actual point of movies: pleasing the people and giving them SOMETHING TO REMEMBER, not to meet standards that grouchy and lonely so- called ""critics"" set to make it boring and stupid).It seems like many Nolan haters and so called ""astrophysicists"" all criticize the film by attacking Nolan, not the film. This is laughable because for one, no one will pay attention to their comments besides other Nolan haters who will vote ""Yes"" (agree) by filtering for and finding fellow worst reviews. This film will stay in the top 50, or maybe even reach the top 10 as things are looking right now, and the haters will drown in the crowd of people who acknowledge and can see that this is a great movie.

Why input lots of useless dialogue or scenes? The only part I like is actually the part they're not in space, as the effect on space is not really good and gets a little boring overtime. If I want to watch a movie with space, I prefer and suggest to watch Cosmos: A Space TimeOdyssey (2014), it have more awesome visual stunning effects than this movie and also more clever approach for your brain because it teaches you REAL science. Maybe Nolan is not ready to make a Space Movie. If you think this is the best space movie of all time, I suggest you watch the Alien (1979) and Aliens (1986), Star Wars and Star Trek franchises, and 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968).

Because to me I thought it was amazing. The score by Hans Zimmer is one of his best yet. Of course the directing by Christopher Nolan was another strong point of delivering the experience. The acting was nothing special, not undelivered but I found there were no particular scenes for McConaughey to really stand out in as we all know he has the capability to do so.

Christopher Nolan and Co. strayed very far from their previous work (The Dark Knight Trilogy, Inception) by created one of those most thought provoking films I have seen to date. I have read many interviews from the cast and filmmakers about this film and I wasn't quite sure what they were trying to say. Chris Nolan said it is very different than anything they have ever done before and it's true. I never would've thought I would see a film like this by Nolan. It's truly remarkable.Interstellar is about Earth. Earth is dying. Fast. In the near future, simple pleasures have disappeared and most human life are working towards survival. Food has run out and shelter is more important than one might think as giant dust storms push through. Cooper, playing by McConaughey, is a farmer. An excellent farmer, but also a trained pilot and engineer. He stumbles across the remnants of NASA, which is believed to have been shut down as the world is no longer in need of technology. Professor Brand, played by Michael Caine, is an old friend of Cooper's as he tells him that saving Earth is beyond our capacity and we must find a new home in outer space. Cooper agrees and leaves his family behind to embark on the interstellar journey. The films flows and feels like a documentary, which is how Nolan wanted to shot it, and creates a more thrilling movie experience. In past Nolan films where we expect action and edge-of-your-seat thrills we get intimate discussions of the endless amount of possibilities of what could have if... If they fail to act, if they fail their mission, if they fail each other and everyone they left home.This film is beautiful, passionate and terrifying. The great mountain of tidal waves on the distant planet is one of the most terrifying imagines I have ever seen. And I guess Nolan is a dick, since he put two of them in there. But overall, I really enjoyed every 169 minutes of this film and I continue to believe that Christopher Nolan is one of the rarest type of filmmakers we have these days: a good one."

The dialog is near-perfect with but does degrade into sentimentality at times. If only it was as subtle as the humour which was spot on. For whatever reason, I found the movie had a similar vibe at times to Prometheus and the first Star Trek movie. Again, I think that the linkage is the coldness and vastness of space.

Why would a daughter be angry with her dad for 40 years and still react like a 10-year-old? Why would a scientist give a long speech about the multidimensionality of love to convince other scientist to go to one planet or the other.The visual effects, though are outstanding and I would definitely watch a movie of like 30 minutes just of the space footage. But that doesn't get you over three hours.That's another point. Recent movies tend to be longer and longer when they don't have to. It doesn't help neither the story nor the suspense to have it made this long.All in all, in my opinion, the movie is overestimated and if it wasn't for the visual effects I would definitely not recommend watching it."

The Film was almost 3 hours long though i wouldn't mind if it was 6 hours long,Christopher Nolan delivers not just a an epic movie but a movie whose roots will go down as deep as 2001:A Space Odyssey in the history of cinema. The movie starts showcasing the problems faced by mankind due to food crisis and then slowly drags to the accidental discovery of the secret NASA by Matthew McConaughey ,then starts the expedition of a lifetime or an expedition which will exceed the lifetime of the people who are up to it.I would say the wormholes and black holes were realistic and they were an act of sheer creation. Coming to the Cinematography there wasn't a shot that was not fit for the my best compliments.The planets,the wormholes,the black holes,the atmospheres and the costumes and what not,everything was beautiful. The score was composed by Hans Zimmer and what he delivered was something that will constantly keep you engaged thorough out the movie.What can I say about the performance given by Matthew McConaughey it was one of the greatest performances delivered by an actor in Sci-Fi movies and the others weren't so bad either save the performance of Wes Bently. Apart from the astonishing features mentioned above the movie also has a comedy side in the form of robots which are programmed to be humorous,to understand the movie you definitely need some scientific knowledge about Blackholes and Wormholes or the you could just enjoy the movie as fan and not as a critic.Finally to conclude this review which i don't want since i have so much to say but i also don't want to bore or reveal the plot of the movie to the readers i would just say, If you ever were to make a list of best Sci-Fi movies ever made this movie will undoubtedly make it to the top 10."
427,479,0.043971937,0.2653682,0.6906598,8,A visual treat for Sci-Fi fans,"As I begin this review of Christopher Nolan's latest movie, I want to point out the gorgeous visuals that we as an audience were able to behold with Interstellar. I truly believe this to be the movie's best quality and a true feat for the people in charge of visual effects. Having said this, I believe that many viewers were divisive over the plot's complexities. In fact, this is the most emotion driven movie I've seen from Nolan, something that he isn't ultimately known for. Nolan's strenght as a director lies in his ability to present us with a vision. He is meticulous and works the technical aspect of a film like no other director today. Once again, this is proved in every frame shot for Interstellar. So leaving behind my long praise, I now redirect this review to the story.The earth is dying, as the effects of our abuse of the natural resources is taking out the crops of food we need to survive. Upon this dark scenario, former NASA engineer Cooper (McConaughey) is asked to pilot a spaceship with the purpose of crossing a wormhole that will lead to another galaxy. This, of course, in hopes of reaching three possible habitable planets explored by scientists sent there in previous missions. Given the unpredictable nature of an unknown environment such as a different galaxy, Cooper will have to decide whether he is willing to sacrifice everything for the sake of humanity or if the urge to reunite with his daughter again is stronger. Personally I liked the story Nolan told us with this film, as it left you thinking about it after the movie was over, something Nolan does very well with his projects. Compared with his previous work, there are still movies that I love more than this. Still Interstellar is a brilliant film in it's own right and yet another great addition to this great director's Filmograhpy.In the end all I can say is, if you're a Sci-Fi fan, you surely must not miss this one. It will offer an unique visual experience and leave you wondering what the hell you just watched, even if you didn't feel completely satisfied.Rating: 8/10"

Incredibly chaotic, inharmonious, confused scenario has become a duty, boring and inharmonious film.Neither the best actors nor high budget can save this film. Pretentious, artificial and false thoughtful, at times boring, banal and full of clichés from other movies - in general very difficult to watch.A casual audience, however, would liked similar mishmash, but for true connoisseurs of cinema this film is simply unbearable. I endured it with a huge annoyance and regret for the lost time and vain expectations."
429,481,0.24029101,0.3814804,0.3782286,9,A Masterpiece on screen!,"Interstellar, directed by Christopher Nolan, is obviously one of my favourite film ever. I confess; every time I hear about a new Nolan's film, I'm scared. I truly am, because every single film he has made were simply incredible. I'm afraid the next one will be, how can I say, worst? Of course not! He surprised me, as he surely does since the release of Doodlebug, Nolan's short film.What I love the most about Nolan is the fact that his films are totally originals. Tell me if I'm wrong, but have you ever had the feeling of: Why haven't I thought about this idea before..? Damn Nolan, you're too smart! When I watched Interstellar, I had this feeling. The same I had for Memento, Inception, The Prestige, and almost every frame of his pieces.Interstellar is a total experience. We can think about the Visual Effects (oscar' winning), or about Sound editing, mixing and of course, the Original Score of Dr. Zimmer! The movie begins with an non-understanding situation, which already makes me a fan of it. We have to think about every single frame of the film. If not, you get lost. The only thing that made me disappointed is the end, because they explained too much. For a few second, I thought I was a child. That embarrassed me, because I think Nolan underestimated the fans. Some people hates this movie, because of its lack of information, but I don't think so!Interstellar is a passion, a taste. If you don't feel it, like it, you'll never understand the information that Nolan is trying to give to the audience. It's a film about the end of an Ere, and the possibility to build a new one. When you watch this movie, you have to absorb what it gives to us, instead of expecting it. As a matter of fact, it still a great great great movie, and that's why I bought it like a month ago, because adding this movie to my collection is a total honour.My theory: - We can predict the end of a film, but we cannot be sure of how they are going to present it!Special thanks to Nolan and Zimmer Vincent Lévesque"

All saying the same thing depending on your point of view: Epic (good) or Long (bad) Visionary (good) or Nonsensical (bad) Kubrick-like (good) or Kubrick-LITE (bad) etc, etc, etc.So instead of a review, here's what I wrote my ex: ""Have you watched Interstallar? If you haven't, DON'T! 3 hours of some of the most tedious and dreadful bore. Put it this way... I was doing taxes at the same time, and a) felt no need to pause the movie at any point, and b) taxes were legitimately more interesting.""It has an amazing IMDb score, but clearly people just want to feel smart with themselves.

431,484,0.021831177,0.24348667,0.73468214,10,Visually stunning sci-fi thrill ride,"Christopher Nolan has made big impressions on us with his visual effects, in summer blockbusters like The Dark Knight trilogy and Inception. However, Nolan takes his visual style and narrative talent up to the next level in this complex science-fiction thriller. Matthew McConaughey (Oscar winner from last year's Dallas Buyers Club) stars as Joseph Cooper, a Texas-native father of two children: daughter Murphy and teenager son Tom, living in the not-too-distant future where the world is running scarce on food supply, crops have declined dangerously low and humanity's day are numbered. He is soon called by NASA to take on a mission to travel through the Galaxy in search of a wormhole that could lead to a new home for humanity. Joining Dr. Amelia Brand (played by Anna Hathaway), he struggles against the complexities and perils of the intergalatic environments as well as the decision between saving humanity and the possibility of seeing his family again. This is one of the most visually striking films I've seen in a long time. Christopher Nolan pushes the boundaries of both visual effects and imagination, and brings some eye-popping visuals taking place in outer space you would never forget. The film succeeds not only with ravaging a stunning visual beauty, but also with plenty of scientific food for thought that leaves viewers curious about the nature of astrophysics. The way the film depicts the wormholes and the black holes comes be a cerebral eye-catcher. Now I am not a science guy so I don't how scientific accurate the film is, but it gives a realistic depiction of reality in space. And the plot, though slow at times, manages to associate well with its powerful and scientifically complex story while abandoning its emotional resonance. Some may argue that the plot doesn't quite sustain its 169-minute runtime. Those numbed by the scientific complexity or slow moving storyline may not stay through beginning to end, but there is plenty of strong elements dotted throughout the duration to captivate viewers Let's not forget the incredible performance by Matthew McConaughey. He did a great job on making his character and the bond with his children in the emotional scenes so believable, just by his emotionally driven acting. Anna Hathaway also delivers a performance that stands strong and honorable.Interstellar is a visually stunning, emotionally powerful sci-fi flick full of surprises and thought-provoking elements that could possibly lead this film to stand as a classic within the next decade. This film is an amazing and striking achievement by Christopher Nolan."

Hard for me to put my finger on, perhaps it feels (to me) just like another movie with this ""New World Energy Message"" plot that Hollywood and people like Echardt Tolle is making a lot of money on.To boil it down, it's not a bad movie - just don't start analyzing it :-)"

This film cost a fortune, talks and lot, and continues the 'schmaltz in space' theme along the lines of Gravity. The first half an hour sets out some interesting ideas and then proceeds to spend the next 2 hours trashing them by way of quasi scientific mumbo jumbo. And who said it was a good idea to have smart-arsed filing cabinets as robots? Don't get me wrong, there are worse ways to spend 2 and a half hours, but the premise that an alien civilization would create a wormhole in space (rather than curing crop blight) just to allow characters as wooden as this to traipse around is pretty shaky. Better films include: Solaris - Original 1972 version"

This movie relies on actual laws: Relativity. Quantum physics. Gravity. It encapsulates all that is cherished as known within sci-fi and keeps it 'simple'. We all understand Gravity (not that other awful sci-fi movie), but very little on how powerful of an effect it has on our universe. The movie is very true to the laws of science, space and time....and is conveyed into a movie that only Christopher Nolan can produce.I was actually reluctant to watch a sci-fi done by Nolan, considering his other amazing works (Memento, The Dark Knight, Inception, The Prestige, and the list goes on and on and on). Just as every Nolan film makes you 'think', this is no different. I loved this movie even more after the second time I watched it. There are many sci-fi loyalists out there that will always argue THEIR movie is the best (2001, Star Wars, Star Trek, etc.) but none of those movies left me feeling the amount of amazement, wonderment, and love as this one had. This is a movie to put those emotions to the side, expect the unexpected, and truly enjoy a film that only the master Christopher Nolan can deliver.Not a spoiler, but I must say this: Watch it at least twice....it may be difficult to grasp the magnitude of information conveyed here after only one viewing. IMAX is epic, but not necessary. Enjoy!!!"

I am not as erudite as some of the negative reviewers here but they are not lying.I hate movies that try to press the same fake emotional buttons over and over again. Parental guilt, love, duty, heroism, blah, blah, blah. This movie does it at every turn until you can't stop groaning.The suspension of disbelief. What every work of fiction aims to achieve. Once that stops working you're in trouble. No you can't drive a truck at top speed with a flat tire through a cornfield without losing control. No corn is not harvested by a combine and left lying on the ground when it is green. Then there were a lot of scientific facts that were ignored or glossed over about space travel. I'm not a scientist but there were many times when I said, ""Wait, what, that doesn't sound right"". Anyway I think I reached the minimum number of characters so I can stop.

I can't stop thinking about this movie, and I'm only writing this review to convince others to see it. Interstellar has everything; great acting, a good plot and story, action, science fact AND fiction, a little romance, a huge (for me anyway) amount of tears, and a story that revolves around real people. The CGI was amazing, but it didn't feel artificial. I wish I could elaborate on what made this movie a winner, but I hate reviews that spoil the movie - what's the point of seeing it if you already know what will happen? Suffice to say, I can't think of a single person who wouldn't like this movie. Two negatives: plot holes, but come on, so much of astro/quantum physics is theory that you have to fill in the answers somehow. I give credit to the Nolan brothers for making a valiant effort. There is one scene where Anne Hathaway's character was speaking that was a little out of place. Other than that, this was a great movie.At the end of it, my kids (18,13), my mom (71), and I (42) all looked at each other and just said, wow. I love leaving a movie when you want to talk about it immediately, then shut up, so you can process it all over again. It's rare these days that a movie does this to me, and I couldn't be happier with how Interstellar made me feel. I will own this movie (and probably re-watch it A LOT). Also, I really hope that a directors cut is released on Blu-Ray, because I have a feeling that there's much more to the story to be told. I can't wait!"

Have the studios hired an army of sycophants or is North Korea hacking movie review sites as well? Perhaps I have been spoiled in the past when I have watched movies that are not only visually arresting but thought provoking and exhibiting some respect for the audience. This movie is lacking any such saving graces. It takes far too long to tell a story that doesn't begin to hold together and does not even succeed as eye candy, which is all that Hollywood is about in this modern age of trying to rescue meaningless tripe with copious amounts of computer generated fluff. So to those of you were dazzled by this drivel, please let me know when the next blockbuster is due. Meantime I will go back to I Love Lucy reruns."

Everything about this movie is great and near perfection. The picture is awesome, the soundtrack breathtaking, the story is very griping, the actors are superb. I guess this movie will make a fuzz at the Oscars. Can't understand how some guys rated it so badly. The premiss of the story is scientifically very strong also and I've heard that it's one of the most accurate movies concerning to astrophysics.

Well actually no, I do see lots of negative comments about this movie in the message board. While I went in expecting a Nolan movie , I was sadly disappointed. I got used to his style of movies which hold my attention throughout, and can even make me watch the movie a few times. This movie is OK with its sci fi story. It does however drag many many times and goes very slow. A lot of drama, and less science fiction. A lot of talking and less adrenaline pumping scenes. The family drama just doesn't ever stop.

When I first heard about it, I was very happy, I couldn't wait to see it. I was sure, that I will do it in Imax, because it deserves the best available! Two days ago finally, with two friends I watched it. None of us was satisfied with the result. My friend was really angry, He was joking, that we should ask our money back. I don't felt so wrong, but: The movie was way too long, very, very loud (maybe it was only a local issue, but sometimes music was so loud, that I couldn't understand what actors told). Story was more or less OK (less...) quite predictable. Science part was below my expectations. We saw lot of similarities with 2001: Space Odyssey, but that movie is a timeless classic.

The problems with this film have nothing to do with people not getting the twist (which wasn't complicated in the slightest if you're familiar with any sci fi other than star wars.) They have nothing to do with whether it gets the science right (which it mostly does.) This film is bad because the plot is doesn't work, characters have little to no character, and most of all the emotional moments fall flat its that simple. Even if every part of the machine works individually it doesn't come together to create something worth watching. Interstellar has neither the heart or balls to achieve what it sets out to and despite moments of ""brilliance"" its a film with the ambition of Kubrick but the execution of Shyamalan.I was really excited for this movie. I'm a big fan of Chris Nolan (though hes not my favorite) but this movie is a 3 hour waste of time if you care at all about experiencing a well told story. The twist is obvious and the movement towards it is clumsy. The plot holes are larger than the black hole around which the movie centers. As a result, I'm not at all surprised to hear that Interstellar was made up of two separate scripts that individually may have been great. I will say I enjoyed the 1st act to an extent and there are some good lines throughout. A few of the actors (specifically Mcconaughey and Caine) give awesome performances. Maybe a great editor could have saved this film but ultimately it comes off too cold and sterile for the emotions to hold any weight. Do yourself a favor. See something else"
