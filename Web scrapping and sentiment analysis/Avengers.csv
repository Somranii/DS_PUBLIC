And, firstly, I need to say a big thank-you to Disney and Marvel Studios.Now, the film... how can I even begin to explain how I feel about this film? It is, as the title of this review says a 'comic book triumph'. I went into the film with very, very high expectations and I was not disappointed.Seeing Joss Whedon's direction and envisioning of the film come to life on the big screen is perfect. The script is amazingly detailed and laced with sharp wit a humor. The special effects are literally mind-blowing and the action scenes are both hard-hitting and beautifully choreographed.While all of these things (script, action, special effects and so on and so forth) are important... it's no good having them spot on if you don't have a cast that just isn't right. But fortunately, for fans and for the actors involved, Whedon's cast not only work brilliantly together but are perfectly comfortable wailing on each other and threatening each other all day and night.The actors' performances in ""Marvel's The Avengers"" are simply captivating and there are many instances where we get a glimpse further into their characters pasts and innermost feelings. Robert Downey Jr. will have you in stitches. Scarlett Johansson will have you staring in disbelief as she winds her way through sticky situations. And Tom Hiddleston will have you simply shaking in your seat with fear.All in all, Marvel's The Avengers is a visual delight and I cannot wait to see it again, and again, and again. Marvel fans will not be disappointed, and something tells me that most of you will agree with me wholeheartedly.The Avengers, assembled and awe-inspiring. Ten out of ten."
1,3,0.7359727,0.22425172,0.039775603,1,A consummate failure - here's why,"Here's why ""The Avengers"" fails so badly.1. Wrong, wrong director - Joss Whedon is a TV Director. ""Serenity"" worked because it was essentially a TV movie. And he has here made ""The Avengers"" a TV movie. Bad move, this should have gone to J.J. Abrams, Bryan Singer or Brad Bird.2. Dreadful miscasting - only Robert Downey Junior can hold his head high. Chris Evans is as wooden in this as the flat ""Captain America"" film. Those playing Thor, Hulk, Black Widow either phone in performances or look embarrassed.3. Weak, weak villain - Tom Hiddleston plays a slight, camp character who offers little panache or interest and more closely resembles a spoiled teenager than anything else. This film needed a ""General Zod"".4. Too much obvious CGI - come on, it's 2012, there's no excuse for the George Lucas-y effects like the flying Shield craft graphics.5. No drama, tension and a script so obviously flat that Whedon inserts misplaced self conscious quips to lighten the tone.For anyone growing up with Marvel comics in the 70's (chime with me on this), we deserved SO much more. For younger audiences, it will pass I'm sure.Really can't understand though the positive reviews. Am I alone in this ?"
2,4,0.008833456,0.096105315,0.8950612,9,Nothing Short of Amazing,"I just saw the early screening for San Diego through the top 10 cities on facebook who got them. And suffice to say I am glad I was privileged enough to.First off, this hands down is the best Marvel movie ever. I don't say that lightly. And in terms of superhero movie with maybe the Nolan Batman series being tied with this, I thought Whedon did an amazing job to bring out all these characters in this one movie. I especially like what was done with Hawkeye and Black Widow just because those two didn't really have their individual movie with their back story. You can tell when a comic book fan writes and directs a comic movie because it clearly showed in all areas of production for this film. Going into the film I honestly thought that a lot of the cool mutant action scenes would be strictly Iron Man and Captain America. But Whedon does such a great job giving each mutant their 15 mins of fame and by the end of it you seriously feel like ""Wow this guy/chick is a badass"" for every mutant. I will admit i am not a Hulk fan. I like the inner story for it but was never a fan of the films, show or comic. But Hulk's role in the movie is so awesome I became a fan just from it. If any of you are Whedon fans then you guys/girls will love this movie. It has his M.O. written all over the humor and story presentation. And there were definitely parts in the movie where I thought ""Wow this seems like Firefly and Serenity"". And story aside, if you read, watched, or idolized Marvel superheros as a kid, the action alone will make you cheer just out of sheer nostalgia of imagining The Avengers or X-Men all together on the screen kicking ass. In summation, I don't need to say you NEED to watch this movie because I think anybody who is anybody already knows they want to see this. All this review has done was just reaffirm the hype behind this movie. I don't say this much but job well done Marvel and Disney for hiring a writer/director who has the audaciousness to keep it honest and true for those most dedicated comic fans who are the backbone of Marvel comics being a success. And in this day and age of superhero movies and movies in general that is very hard to do. Cheers Joss Whedon!"

Very good acting from all the main characters and good acting from the rest. Great Directing and writing from Joss Whedon too. The cinematography was stunning throughout the whole film.This is a fun action packed film for the whole family to enjoy just like the rest of the Marvel movies but better. The special effects by far are the best for any Marvel movie. The Hulk Looks so much more real. By the way The Hulk made the movie even better. Also, DO NOT SEE THE AVENGERS IN 3D! See the film because you will not be disappointed even if you are not that interested into superhero movies. It has a lot of humor and love, so again SEE IT!"

Actually I slept through some of it so there was SOME valuable time spent in the theater. I would have walked out except my girlfriend look like she was enjoying it. This movie just sucked, plain and simple. It's the typical good guys have to save the earth from aliens. It did have all the emotions though.....The dialog was laughable and the acting made me want to cry. Unless you just like seeing buildings getting demolished and people who are impervious to bullets, explosions, and every kind of weapon known to man, stay home and save your money. I've watched better cartoons as a kid. It actually angers me that there are so many people in this world the simply LOVED this movie. This movie was so bad, I may never go to the theater again!"
5,7,0.9498042,0.042886607,0.0073092096,5,Very Boring & Disappointing,"Oh my god ! .. The Avengers was a big disappointment to me ! I can't believe how doll and bored I was during the 2 hours and 20 minutes playtime of the movie ..The directing was so bad and I think the director thinks the audience are so stupid or retarded to believe those cheap story lines or cheap jokes or even cheap plot .. The script was so cheap and boring and the characters didn't blend with each other at all ..I'm not even impressed by the special effects of the movie .. I think X-Men 3 or Spider Man showed a lot more special effect than this one .. I nearly enjoyed the last scene of the entire movie but this was not enough for such a movie who earned unbelievable high ratings ..Finally, when I knew that the director has never directed such super hero movies and he has only directed for the TV (like Buffy series), I know why this movie sucked !! still can't believe how it got 8.6 really !!"
6,8,0.6629251,0.26857963,0.06849526,1,How did this get in the top 100?,"This film is is an empty shell covered with dazzling lights. Sure, it does look pretty but that is as far as it goes.Nothing interesting happens in this film (by interesting I mean plot wise, not a standard fight scene with new people copied and pasted into it) the 'plot' is horrific, to the point in which you wonder if there actually is a one. Hollywood seem to use the same script for every action film they make, only they replace a few of the more minor details so hopefully people won't notice. In an attempt to keep at least some of the male (and select female) audience awake the director decides it is time for Scarlett Johansson to pop up on screen to show off her, lets say defining costume in such an obvious manner. It is just a cheap, cheap film full of filler material that you will enjoy if you have an inability to think for yourself.I really have no idea how this film got into the top 100 of all time, there is really no reason for it to be there. The only plus sides are that the acting and cast are superb, it is just a shame that they were not involved in something where their talents could have been used in more fulfilling roles."
7,9,0.87504816,0.10261171,0.022340182,1,"An unsurprising, mind-numbing interminable bore","What a disappointment, although really not surprised at how bad it was. A totally boring, endless and mostly witless movie aimed at brain-deadened people who think that special effects, explosions and fantasy but definitely not fantastic characters make for a great movie. The cinematography was gray and cloudy, the editing incomprehensible, and the acting unsurprising and depressingly familiar. Simple, human emotions, which used to be integral to a movie are now so rare. Noise and all-too-familiar mayhem have been substituted. The attention span of the audience, when not being bombarded by yet another special effect, shifts quickly to their cell phone when things slow down even a bit. To think that more-of-the-same will be the order of the day is depressing. Count me out."
8,11,0.66470176,0.22497366,0.11032458,3,Very Disappointed,"I booked tickets for this as my boyfriend wanted to catch it before it left the cinemas, and from the trailer it looked like great fun, but after a very achy backside from sitting and squirming through 2 an half hours of this tripe, bored out of my brain, just wasn't worth it! The only good thing about this film was Downy Jr, hes an incredible actor in his own right, and if it wasn't for him I'd be giving it 0/10. Just cant understand why people are soooo hyped over it, very cliché, bad acting (apart from Jr) dialogue was atrocious, and the story has been done time and time before.. Yawn! I was expecting something sooo much more from this film and it fell flat."
9,13,0.5863908,0.33800748,0.07560173,1,"Every cliché known to man, and cinema as a game console","By geeks, about geeks, for geeks. Tempting the geek dollar out of its den into the local multiplex with a thrill that can't be bought on the Xbox.Is it The West Wing in space? Or is it Stargate meets X-Men? There is not a shred of originality or true imagination in this noisy, flashy, ugly commercial behemoth. It is part of an action figure marketing campaign; a film made by men who still think like pre-teenagers, who were inspired long ago by comic books cheaply churned out by groups of at most six people - who at least had a grasp of characterization.The now-grown comic-book readers have to remain in their adolescent playrooms and pay homage to that excitement because they dare not go out into the world and feel real suspense, fear, or loss. They must burn gazillions of dollars and employ thousands of people in trying to recreate that comic-book buzz. A long-lost childish thrill is the only feeling they are willing to let themselves - or you - experience.Will you join them? Will you sit in a darkened room pretending that you are engaging with life because you have a 3D screen, surroundsound, and a broadband connection? Will it be enough for you to escape into Joss Whedon's stunted teenage netherworld, or will you go outside and attempt to engage with - god forbid - strangers, rather than aliens, superheroes and vampires?There are movies, even trashy ones, that will echo, embellish and enhance your experience of the world. 'Avengers Assemble' isn't one of them; it's shiny, expensive, overwrought trash that assumes we are all as insecure, stupid and frustrated as those who created it.You will have forgotten it long after you still remember how much it cost to get in. Choose life."
10,14,0.97534376,0.022064479,0.0025918218,1,Absolutely rotten,"This was a terrible film. The lines were cheesy. The action sequences were predictable. Every sequence that rolled out on screen had already been done to death by countless action films before- there was nothing new, fresh, catching or anything innovative for that matter in the way the film was shot, scripted and acted. Just when I thought things couldn't get any worse, the low brow, tasteless racist slanderer of Captain America (Yes I know he was doing it to show this mindset was still of that of a white American of the 1940's) towards Samuel Jackson's character made me want to walk out of the film. And I'm not even black. A complete waste of money on my behalf. To see this film receive the high acclamation that it has just goes to show how brainwashed the general population has become due to the continuous release and production of these utterly mind-numbing, idiotic films.Not even worth a star."
11,15,0.83458626,0.13932025,0.026093537,2,only the distant echo of a powerful shout,"I just saw the movie. I have been a comic reader and a movie goer for more than twenty years now, and a film like this should have been my wet dream. Instead what I saw was a hollow, empty attempt to recreate the magic of the original comic book: an attempt that poorly fails in a miserable way despite (or I should say: thanks to) all the special effects and the star power the producers have tried to throw in. The fantasy, the wit, the ideas that were present in the comic and that made it the dreams and the joy of so many kids, were completely absent in this studio behemoth. I will admit that the recreation of such magic was a difficult task, probably doomed from the beginning: but this thing is completely lacking brain, or direction, or any meaning at all. The script is a total and utter disaster, full of bore and incredibly shallow, and it goes just ridiculous every time it tries to go funny with sketches and jokes all very similar between themselves. I will rate the movie 2 stars just to give it credit for having been able to give us the first decent Banner/Hulk: it took only three attempts to the Hollywood writers - and god knows how many millions of dollars wasted. Movies like ""Avengers"" are unlucky children that inherit only all the defects from both the parents, which in this case would be Mr. Mainstream Comics and Mrs. Movie Industry. This leaves them with basically no audience: they are too much gruesome and boring for kids, too much childish for youngsters, while for the adults - at least for those the grown-up ones - there are just too many capes. The same stories, printed on comic pages, still resonate in popular culture after decades: but this movie will be hopefully forgotten as soon as the media battage slow down."
12,16,0.6610251,0.27916193,0.059812978,1,Most overrated movie,This is the most overrated movie of this year. There is nothing special in the movie except few humour. The story is pretty old and and we can bow for the special effect.But the special effect has been wasted for such a movie with no story. Movie such as Darknight has rating of 8.9 which is worth but this movie is not worth for such ratings.Its a childish story. Please give good ratings for good movies. Movie is worth watching once but surely this is not special movie for such hyper rating.Hollywood movies of recent days does not have good story but gives more importance to special effect.
13,17,0.04381235,0.22896208,0.72722554,10,average,the avengers was an okay movie. I heard so much hype about the avengers and i didn't think it was amazing it was an okay film not really terrible and it wasn't amazing it was okay. The acting was okay but the effects were pretty good actually but because it was in 3d. I would say it deserves an acadamy award for best sound effects not best acting.every body is saying best film of the year you cant just say that right away the only film you can say the best film of the year is the Mario Puzos The Godfather. I liked the way that they put most of marvels Super Heros into one movie but only one villain. There should have been more villains in the film in summary the avengers was an OK film.
14,18,0.87308854,0.111974716,0.014936662,1,NOT Worth the wait!,"Went to sneak of Avengers tonight in Austin and wish I hadn't wasted the couple hours or so! Very disappointing. Wish I had sold or given away the passes. I remember a time where the story was the most important part of the movie, instead of just smart quips and CGI explosions to make up for it. I guess it is all about making a quick buck. ""Hey, lets put all these elements together and make a killing off the rubes!"" Thing is, we will accept lower and lower quality films, and have no one to blame but ourselves. Don't like silly cars that turn into metallic aliens anyone? I would wait for HBO or the like if you must see this. On a VERY related subject: who are the morons in marketing who decided that they should over-book a sneak so a good third of passes are turned away? From the angry/disappointed faces on the adults and KIDS who were leaving, I am wondering how all the bad will generated helps promote a film? They should barely over book by say, 1% so that people with lives aren't at the mercy of slackers who sit around all day with nothing else going on but to sit all day. Grade C for movie and promotion."
15,21,0.0034731543,0.04733927,0.9491876,10,Beyond Excellent. Avengers Hits At The Highest Level!,"Yep, Marvel has done it again but this time to the max! You can rest assured that Avengers is an absolutely amazing movie. I'm so glad Marvel got in to the solo movie making business. Instead of leasing out their characters to other studios, they're making movies themselves and have not missed yet. (Sony pooping on Ghost Rider again this very year is a great reminder of that) Avengers is, without a doubt, their best effort yet! Personally, I think they set the bar leading up to this movie and they just clean blew the bar in to orbit with this movie.Avengers really takes the comic book genre to the highest level. They along with a select few others reinvented epic adventure as this century began by ""Marvelizing"" characters by making them more believable and more relatable. Spider-Man and the X-Men did this to a degree but only as far as their respective studios wished to stay true to the source material. Anything added or amended was for the benefit of the live action adaptation. Nolan did this for Batman and Raimi for Spider-Man. They pulled it off by talking to the summer crowd, not down to them. Favreau, Branagh and Johnston did similar good work for Marvel leading up to this gem. Now, Joss Whedon not only continues that tone but adds to the work that's come before. It's like the ultimate team work and Whedon brings it all home and all together perfectly. Like the great films of the past, he grounds the action and the superhero concept in firm reality. The humor and acknowledging the absurd nature of everything we see adds the perfect flavor. Yet, all the character depth and relationship nuances are fleshed out well as with any other good film.I've said it before but it's brave to reach for the highest common denominator with a big budget film and Avengers delivers a movie with as much feeling as it has action and intensity. It's a movie that has a wonderful balance that delivers intelligence with its fun. This is, without a doubt one of my top 10 movies of 2012, quite possibly THE best regardless of genre. I don't see anything changing that for the rest of the year. This movie is just that good"
16,22,0.6690785,0.26649433,0.06442712,1,awful boredom,"movie is only and only for ages between 6-16. anyone with any expectation from cinema should skip this one. a movie for video game addcits. no clear plot. everything is foreseeable. nothing new. just piled on to make a difference. too much of mediocre ends up creating something less then mediocre. pity the time and the money i spent on this usual Hollywood garbage. i think people should wait for it to come on TV. not even worth the DVD or bluray. everyone here with a positive comment has a fantasy world where, super heros are logical. if the movie was shorter maybe i could let myself go, but it is tooooo long brother. telling you skip this one and thank me later."
17,23,0.28102955,0.35069126,0.36827922,1,Crap,"Okay first of all I am not your snooty critic who likes silent movies, artsy stuff. I love the action movies, super hero comics. I loved captain America movie, iron man was good too. However this movie was mindless crap. There were no plot variations, dialog's were comical at best. It was just pointless CGI effects. The villain had absolutely no depth and frankly was brainless. At least change the script a bit, put in some variations in the script and hire actors who have depth in acting. Captain America at least had a decent story line, you could connect with the character, the same with iron man and the same with the spider man series. This one from the start was just mindless violence, aliens blowing up crap. All super hero movies should have a good story line, a villain who can many shades to their character. That's why Dark Knight was so good not only because the script had some meaning(terrorism, seeing the good versus bad in people) and of course Heath ledger amazing rendition of the Joker. I realize this isn't a movie that will win an Oscar and also it's meant to park your brain at home and just enjoy but at least put in some effort instead of just letting computer animation take over. Hollywood is getting lazier by the minute."

It's all eye candy and if there were spoilers i wouldn't mention them here. The hulk in this movie unlike its previous incarnation is modelled on a gorilla, yes king kong! I didn't like that at all, its look, movement and facial expressions. I wanted to see a powerful superhuman not a monkey in a circus ""you'll know what i mean"" lol.The reason I gave my review an extra star is because there were moments where i laughed. It is funny. But this doesn't make up for the weak cliché'd story and forced boring dialogue cut scenes between action sequences.The other star goes to the setting and set designs, which were appreciated.The acting was good but the film's action reminded me of a WWE Royal Rumble match. Can't wait for the DARK KNIGHT RISES! It may raise my IQ.thanks"

Capitan America is a really weak super hero, boring boring boring, i felt asleep all the first hour of the movie. I want my money back. Also the aliens(soldiers) are not so good... Iron man was OK.

I did so because this movie took me back to my childhood like no other movie did.Sure, it's not intellectually pretentious or groundbreaking from a cinematic or storytelling point of view, but it delivers perfectly.The wit, conflict, adventure, heart and sense of wonder that I once found in my crazy uncle's attic, slumbering inside those weird looking and dusty Marvel Magazines - populated with super-soldiers, handsome flying scientists, Norse gods, green monsters and incredibly hot chicks in black leather - are here.As I grew up, I somehow repressed the idea that there was no such thing as fictional happiness. These characters will never exist, and it sure takes suspension of disbelief to watch them run about. But this movie reminded me of what they made me feel before girls, party nights, college,taxes and other complicated, serious things came along. As the movie ended, I felt overwhelmed by the readjustment to reality as I knew it in my young adult life.I watched this with my 10 year old nephew. I don't know if that makes me the crazy uncle, but it sure was great to be back in that attic, even for a while. I always knew Hulk smashed. Now I know he always will."

For a movie with such hype, it was very long and the picture was very dark. Too many overly dramatic lines, and the buildup music lasted for practically the whole movie. I usually love superhero movies, but this one was a letdown. I don't know why it got such great ratings. The Iron Man, Thor, Hulk, and Captain America movies were more enjoyable on their own. I thought it would be great to see all these heroes come together, but I think it really just lead to so many main characters that the audience didn't get a chance to understand any of them individually. Special effects were great, don't get me wrong, and the 3D was cool, but that wasn't enough to save the movie. Storyline was too stretched out. Underwhelming opening. The movie didn't evoke my emotions (I wasn't scared, sad, excited, relieved when I should have been). A bunch of characters that are interesting on their own plus special effects does not equal a great movie. Overall, I'm disappointed."

This is the best superhero movie I have ever seen.It is about superheroes and it is made with today's technology. Today's technology allows movie makers to design scenes that were technologically impossible before. Any other previous superhero movie I have seen was worse.If you never got into superhero comics then this is not a movie for you.Now back to the summary line. Some (sorry) idiotic reviewers are comparing this movie to: Memento, Blade Runner, Psycho, The Empire Strikes Back, The Matrix, etc. And talking about lack of symbolism, depth, twists, etc. ""This movie doesn't deserve this high rating, etc."" Are you people on drugs?Possible explanations for these 1 star ""punisher"" reviews are: 1 some people just love to hate or 2 they had a bad day or 3 they want to show off their ""expert"" knowledge of ""le cinema"" or 4 they were simply on drugs while watching this movieSo bad news guys: This movie does not have the hyper-realism of ""The Bicycle Thief"", the supreme intrigue of ""Citizen Kane"", the old fashion romance of ""Casablanca"", or the sublime dialogs of ""12 Angry Men"". This is only the best superhero movie I have ever seen.I am 50, I have an engineering degree, my favorite pastime is movies, my favorite genre is Sci-Fi, my favorite movie is Blade Runner and THIS IS STILL THE BEST SUPERHERO COMIC BOOK ADAPTATION I HAVE EVER SEEN (sorry for shouting) and this is why in my review this movie deserves a 9 (not 10 because it is not art).If you want to see an ""artsy"" movie check out ""The Bicycle Thief"" (and take some antidepressants with you). If you want to see what a ""real"" superhero would do see ""Chronicle"" (highly recommended).If you want to see a good comic book adaptation you cannot do any better than this movie"

For example, the showdown against Loki's army is basically Transformers 3 final battle with different characters, and a less talented direction.The only real surprises come from humor: I have to admit that comic reliefs are effectively funny. Apart from this, you'll find nothing but cheesy costumes, woody and/or pointless dialogues, tons of derivative spectacularity and a plot that often seems to go nowhere (Black Widow, with all that chatting aimlessly about her past, is particularly confusing).And Thor's hammer is blatantly fake."

Looks like something from the movies of 20 years ago, cheap materials galore. I'm really surprised to see so many favorable reviews of this movie. The ""comic lines"" in the film mostly by Tony Stark are the cheeziest bunch of dad jokes I've heard.

They have really put a lot of efforts in the new Hulk to bring him up to join the party with others,and Boy! it does pay off exceptionally well.Iron Man's powers are tested to a very new level and being the most skilled avenger,they had to be.He has got some new moves, watch out for them!.I am really starting to like Captain America and the way he handles the situation. The time transitioned character of his, adjusts surprisingly quickly to the new scenario.Black Widow and Hawk-Eye who had brushing references in previous movies are full fledged avengers now, but i wish marvel to bring them up in singles.There are a few much needed subtle humorous moments exercising your jaws sideways in between a lot of fantastically choreographed action scenes keeping them dropped down for most of the time.Bout the cast, Downey Jr. undoubtedly stands out as an actor, with his amazing comic timing and the way he carries the arrogance of Iron-Man. The search for Bruce Banner has ended up giving the most subtle hulk yet,with Mark Ruffalo.The Rest of the cast looks just supportive. Cobie Smulders was supposed to be the eye candy,but Scarlett Johansson steals the show in that aspect, not to mention in her alter-ego superhero moves too.All in all, an awesome summer blockbuster with wholesome entertainment. The Avengers is surely one of the best action movies to watch before you leave this dimension."

And to read this film grossed over $600MM makes me lack faith in the movie public. The Avengers has virtually no character development or plot. It basically is non stop chase scenes and things exploding, with an extreme amount of loud noise. I don't think there were more than several quiet, dialog times the entire movie. I kept thinking that the movie would settle down and get to a meaningful story, but it did not happen. I even was watching it in 3D but that did not help. If one wants to go see continual actions stunts and things exploding, then this is the movie for you.

The story had the perfect balance of comedy, action and drama (yes, there's a bit of that too and it's good). It's everything a comic book fan would want out of a comic book adaptation movie.Every member of the Avengers line-up (whether super powered or not) got the right amount of screen time; if you were like me and thought that Iron Man would get accidentally hog the screen because the trailers made the movie look like ""IRON MAN AND FRIENDS,"" your fears will be washed away. Mark Ruffalo also stole the show as Banner/ The Hulk; if you had a few doubts about him playing the character after Edward Norton was left behind, fear not since he does the job well. I can go as far as saying that Ruffalo is the best incarnation of Banner so far. Josh Whedon pulled off the impossible; he wrote and directed a perfect comic book adaptation.

Mind you, I liked it--but I think I preferred the earlier films before the Avengers team was formed. There was a certain charm that I didn't quite see recaptured in the film. Now the film is good--it's just that what I like in these other films I would have liked more of in ""The Avengers"". Specifically, the movie could have used a bit more humor and a bit more character development. When I read the IMDb trivia, it seems that originally the film had about 30 more minutes--all showing Steve Rogers (Captain America) trying to adjust to his new life. I would have LOVED seeing all this--and less of the HUGE battle at the end of the film. For me, it just felt numbing after a while and I would have liked more of the characters when they weren't fighting.

There was always a small doubt that The Avengers (2012) may have been a flop for a couple of reasons. The first is the fact that the Captain America (2011) and Iron Man 2 (2010) were slightly lower than the standard of movies Marvel studios had shot out since 2008 when The Incredible Hulk (2008) hit the big screens.

This is something what has NEVER been done before & Marvel has got there finger on the pulse. In 1998, a minor marvel character featuring a human/vampire hybrid made it way to the big screen. In 2000, a group of mutants evolved into the box office. In 2002, was the year of the Spider.After Daredevil, Hulk (Ang Lee), The Punisher, Elektra, Man-Thing, Fantastic Four & Ghost Rider, Marvel Studios would start producing its own films and distribute them through Paramount Pictures & the funding will come from a seven-year, $525 million revolving credit facility with Merrill Lynch. The result led to the creation of the ""Marvel Cinematic Universe"". Sounds cool, right? It was. No, really, It F***in' was. Iron Man made its motion picture debut, The Hulk got rebooted, Thor & Captain America have ""FINALLY"" got the Big screen treatment. Then came a huge shift in the Marvel universe.... Marvel Entertainment is now owned by Mickey Mouse.Amazing. Disney let go the Power Rangers franchise & bought Marvel.But after everything from comics to TV & film Marvel has put out it comes to show just how far they come as a company & knowing the fact that the biggest supporters (including me) are the fans. That is why they CAN NOT Disappoint us. Yeah, we complain about story lines, costumes & special effects, But if they stay true to the comics, the films would have done its justice.

I've loved Joss Whedon's work my entire life and I had enjoyed all the previous Marvel films that led up to this one, especially Iron Man. But the fact that they brought together all of these different characters from all these different movies and put them together in 2 1/2 hour film was unprecedented and almost seemed impossible. But the optimist in me got me to the theater with me expectations shaky. Once the film started I was quickly drawn in and once the title appeared on the screen I knew that Joss Whedon had done it. The Avengers is without a doubt my favorite Marvel film and even my favorite action film ever made. Whedon did a great job writing this masterful, witty script that ingeniously put together all these characters and made it flow perfectly. The actors did such a great job playing these characters again and it didn't seem like anyone was underutilized and everyone got a chance to be in the spotlight(especially the hulk). Once you see all of the characters assemble and fight the bad guys you can't help but fill with happiness. The entire movie was such a fun thrill ride from the beginning to the end and the ending battle scene was brilliantly done.

Every one of the superheroes gets their moment in the sun. And of course, there's Scarlett's character Black Widow. YUM! I'm giving the movie 10/10 (2D HD version) because it's so entertaining and it fulfilled all my expectations. You won't be disappointed.As far as the format goes though, stick with HD, there wasn't any real 3D moments. If you are hugely into your 3D experience, think twice before paying the extra, there wasn't any stand out 3D moments, but lots of out of focus backgrounds which kinda wasted the small fortune that must have been spent on production.

I enjoy several of these type of films regardless of the company, brand, or filmmaker. For me, I absolutely love The Avengers. It brought out the little kid in me. At 33, cynical and disgruntled, that's a major compliment. I understand that the film is by no means perfect but it was just so much damn fun. It made me want to buy a costume and play make believe in the backyard again. But again, I'm 33, so I mean that figuratively.

Anyone over the age of 7 that has given this film a good review should be ashamed. The absolute saturation of CGI is disgusting, and seems to be enough to forgive the many flaws of this movie. The action is as poor as the humor, which is brutal. I'm not against the Marvel characters, I grew up with them. I know you can't go into certain movies with a critical eye, all I expected from my trip to the cinema was to be entertained. Instead I was saddened, shocked and bored to the point of irritation.

Why? It mostly reminded me Transformers 2 and Transformers 3 --- which were both god-awful movies. Very similar pointless action and destruction without any weight. If compared to Nolan's Batman -films, this is very cheap storytelling without gravity.Also: I almost slept watching The Avengers. There is no threat what so ever. The villains are plastic robots. Very boring. No tangible psychology behind it.There's no story. The flying ship is hugely boring. Most of the so called heroes are sissies in thighs (Thor, Loki, Arrow-Dude, Captain Boring etc) with exception of The Iron-Fellow who wears steel.Anything good? Not really. I give one star from male-perspective -- Scarpetta Johansson (as it's nice to call her) is surprisingly watchable when trapped in her chair. Cheap trick, but works. Also other male star --- Hulk is interesting those few seconds he got reasonable sequences.All in all. Two stars.

Joss ""Firefly"" Whedon was the director and co-writer on this highly ambitious project that is an adaptation of the Marvel Comics superhero team co-created by Stan Lee (who also appears in a very small cameo, like almost every other movie adaptation of a superhero he had a hand in creating) and the late Jack Kirby. Steve Rogers/Captain America (Chris Evans), Tony Stark/Iron Man (Robert Downey, Jr.), Bruce Banner/The Incredible Hulk (Mark Ruffalo), Thor (Chris Hemsworth), Natasha Romanoff/The Black Widow (Scarlet Johansson), and Clint Barton/Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner) are the six misfits chosen by Nick Fury, Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D. (Samuel L. Jackson) to defeat the traitorous Asgardian misfit Loki (Tom Hiddleston) and his alien army from laying waste to New York City. And of course, six characters usually accustomed to working alone have to work out their differences and come together as a team to save the world. What gets ""The Avengers"" many points is that beside its big action sequences, fights and special effects, we never really lose sight of the characters (who are usually relegated to the background in a movie like this) and who they are. I liked that the movie actually spent time developing the individual characters so that we get to know them all over again - even though they've all already appeared in previous superhero films. It's all big superhero fun, with a knowing wink and an outstanding sense of humor that manages to elicit some strong laughs from anyone viewing this thing with an open mind. Sit back and enjoy!10/10P.S.: What happened to Dr. Henry ""Hank"" Pym/Giant-Man and Janet van Dyne/The Wasp?

So, when at the end of every movie, a post credits scene was shown depicting that there is something even greater planned, the expectations were raised pretty high.Joss Whedon (Firefly, Cabin in the Woods) took into account that set expectations, of both comic book fans and non-fans alike, and put together a superhero flick that'll rest proudly as the conclusion to its predecessors. The screenplay writers, the VFX studio, the actors (Robert Downey Jr. has always been my favorite) all deserve credit.An action packed, blockbuster movie that already has every record broken and every voice cheering, The Avengers is one of the best movies this year.

Brilliant comic-based movie that is, for me personally, the second best Marvel movie ever made, right behind Howard the Duck (kidding, kidding the first Iron Man film obviously). Joss Whedon further proves, as if any more evidence was needed, that as a writer/director he's amongst the top of his field. This is also the best Hulk film ever made and makes it more of a shame that the ball was dropped so badly in his own films. Bruce Banner is the stand out, but all the main superheroes have their very memorable moments, save for Hawkever whom is woefully underused and I hope his role is a tad flashed out on the upcoming extended cut.But really my minor gripes about the movie are few and far between.

Surely when the Avengers came out and I saw the rating (8.8 ?!), I assumed that I was wrong. Such great score! I just had to see this magnificent, most brilliant movie ever.

It felt like a high budget TV episode. The look felt stark and unrealistic (or actually, too realistic probably). It seems to have been filmed for 3D, because even in 2D you you just get lots of weird camera angles and a strange tone to it.The story... well, I just found it hard to pay attention for even the most shortest of times. It just was people doing stuff, but no sense of direction, or story, or building menace. In fact the menace looked like a Stargate TV series villain. Or something from a kids' movie.And the thing is with Stargate, I love the characters. But I don't with this film. They give me no reason to love them. So their actions are thus uninteresting.It doesn't surprise me, seeing afterwards, that Joss Whedon directed it.

How can you expect less from a movie that has Iron Man, Captain America, Hulk, and Thor in it? It was the perfect blend of drama, action and comedy.

If those two elements are in a film for you the character development, creative ideas, acting, script, and cinematography doesn't matter which is very sad and leads me to worry about the misleading rating system for the future of filmmaking. This amateur film is currently rated 101 on IMDb. So you suggesting that this film is better than Batman Begins, Heat, Pans Labyrinth, Blade Runner, Rosemary's baby, The Deer Hunter, Jaws, Warrior, Let the right one in and the list goes on.

The Avengers movie I saw contained no character development whatsoever; no character starts off ignorant, growing to enlightenment, or overcomes cowardice to become a hero, or any other example of behavioral character arcs. By the end, they are as they begun, unchanged, and definitively two-dimensional. The lack of character development is compounded by uninteresting, witless, filler dialogue (despite a few one-liners which managed to draw a giggle), with Dr. Stark and Dr. Banner, i.e. the alter egos of Iron-man and the Hulk, occasionally foraying into esoteric scientific jibber-jabber, that only served to bore me even more. In saying that, Downey Jr's, Tony Stark was the only mildly interesting and amusing character in the entire piece; the rest of the characters I couldn't give a shite about, despite liking them in their stand-alone movies. It seems Director Joss Whedon and pen pal, Zak Penn, are unaware of the law of diminishing returns, whereby the repetition of anything – in this case, fist-fights, and gun and super-power battles – eventually numbs to the point of indifference. Speaking of indifference, the limp-wristed, laughable, horn-wearing villain, Loki, was about as menacing as having a series of ping pong balls pitched at you. And the death of (no spoiler here) was about as emotionally moving as having your pet weevil larvae die. Effects-wise it seems despite the advances in CGI made by Avatar, and Rise of the Planet of the Apes, The Avengers decided to go retrograde, the Hulk looking nothing more than a three-dimensional cartoon, and likewise with Iron-Man and the endless stream of generic alien henchmen. The green-screen for the most part looked phony due to the artificial interior lighting illuminating the actor, mismatching the natural exterior light of the background – an Age-old problem that some directors don't seem to care about, however seriously it affects the suspension of disbelief. Anyway, enough of my moaning; if you like mindless-action with practically no story other than goodies versus baddies, and if you're a fan of Mighty Morphin Power Rangers, you'll love this."

Who directed this bland, one-dimensional shoot-em-up and what have you done with Joss Whedon? This humorless CGI fest could have been handled by any number of robotic Hollywood hacks. I looked forward to this movie because I was over the moon with excitement at the thought that it COULDN'T be a typical jump-cut, screaming video game, and that's pretty much what we have here. The jokes are flat and the dialogue is embarrassing. I thought Scarlett Johannsson was charming, and I usually don't like her too much. But even worse is how the always incredibly watchable Mark Ruffalo was rendered a total snooze, how is that possible? Robert Downey is sarcastic as always and fun to watch but...

If you like that sort of thing, you'll love it. If you are an old-school action movie lover, you'll probably be bored. As for the relationships between the main characters, I was even more disappointed. Dialogues in the film are just an endless series of supposedly funny jokes. The entire movie plays as very loud and expensive comedy. I can't stand Robert Downey, Jr anymore. Someone had said that he is Tony Stark, but the fact is that Tony Stark is Robert Downey Jr. He's not playing a character, he's just being a wise-ass. Actually, he does it in every movie he's in.

A blind person could have seen every part of this movie from 200 miles away, oh wait never mind we have the awesome character hawk eye to do that for us ""whips out his bow and looks like a little child compared to Iron man and Thor and the Hulk(At this time Im laughing and wondering why he was ever written as a character as well as what is this random red headed woman doing in here either?)"". Perhaps I am being harsh, not a lot of the blame is on the director himself, its just 6 utterly awful annoying type A characters that all need the camera time of a full movie to be cool coming together in one movie tired together annoyingly by an awful Samuel Jackson character and with such little background explaining so many twists in the plot, look now I'm running around in my sentences I literally am lost in trying to combine all the horrendous things about this movie into one review. Perhaps if I wrote more reviews I'd be better at this. Anyways thank god for the saving grace of over accomplishing graphics allowing me to see how sweet the hulk can really be otherwise I would've given this a one. Oh just while its on my mind, Jessica Alba plays a better supporting female chick than Scarlett Johansen. I would write more about the utter expletive of this movie, but in order to do that I'd have to watch it again to remind me of all the little expletive I despised, and frankly i don't wanna waste my money doing that. Besides I am tired from staying up for this midnight showing anyways..... So disappointed this movie couldn't be as sweet as the spider man preview I saw 5 minutes before it."

Horrible scripts, least menacing villain ever, no chemistry between the actors, and mundane story line. The movie was immensely over hyped and definitely does not deserve anything near a 8.5 rating. Its alright as a kids movie. It does not come anywhere near the unprecedented standards set by the dark knight or for that matter does not even come close to spiderman 2. The movie is often commended for its humor. In my opinion the humor is extremely dry and futile. Nothing special at all, despite its box office success it would have been better off as an animated movie. So if you want watch at least a decent super hero flick you might as well pick up Watchmen, X-men first class, Spider man 1 or 2 and of course the batman trilogy."

I'm not sure why, but even with the 3D effect - to be honest, didn't make much difference, until the final battle sequence - but even then it was few and far between! I think this film was too loud and infantile and tried too hard to sound sophisticated and too much technical talk - was that supposed to sound impressive? There were a few funny bits, especially with the Hulk, but on the whole the film just dragged on without a real purpose - I hope the supposed sequel will be much better!"

But Mr. Whedon knew what he wanted from the story and has clearly demarcated his territory.This has to be the best superhero movie till date. Robert Downey Jr. (Iron Man / Stark) has been ecstatic in his own witty and superb dialogue delivery, Chris Hemsworth (Thor) is, well, strong and manly, Chris Evans (Captain America) has acted like a true captain specially at the latter part of the movie and between all the action and a surprise, Hulk has smashed everything and has been fun too, for a delightful change. I really think Mark Ruffalo (The Hulk) is the key ingredient which would make people jump on their seats and has added to the fun and excitement to this amazing roller coaster of a movie.I delightfully give this a 10 out of 10 (I hope there was a 11 possible) for allowing me to witness a 2 and a half hour roller coaster, without a break!!!Watch it, if you want to know how Superhero movies should be!"

It's an incredible feat that Joss and all the team have pulled this movie off. There's one very minor little criticism, where two scenes noticeably seemed to cut off the characters heads. That said, I've just seen this film in 2D and I will be going again to see it in 3D. BRILLIANT!! p.s. I'm totally in love with the HULK..swoon!

Some of the action scenes seem to have been thought by a 5 year old.

We've come to expect much more from comic book interpretations. Don't get me wrong, I really enjoyed the Iron Man series, Spiderman and Batman reboots. Where I draw the line I think, is with characters such as Thor and Captain America and to a lesser extent the Hulk - characters who haven't dated too well at all and should have been left in their respective times. They just look so out of place sitting along side the more believable and 'cooler' looking characters like Iron man in present day settings. But anyhow, having seen the high ratings the movie was getting (including on here) I thought 'maybe it cant be so bad after all?' and gave it a look. Sadly my initial instinct was right - this film is well made, has great CGI and acting, but.. its entirely spoilt by the inclusion of silly outdated characters with dubious special powers and a guy who turns into a CGI cartoon green man/monster. I realise that it wouldn't be as much of an assemble without these characters and to substitute spiderman or other superheroes might well upset some purists, but might have made for a better film. Thor in particular is from a bygone era of comic books and should have been left there."

Black Widow is a pathetic excuse for heroine. Along with Hawkeye, who even Jenner said wasn't good at all, was the worst character of 2012, and yes, I did see most of the movies from the 2012 area. This movies is nothing but a generic version of Batman Begins, and I say that one rather than Nolan's other two because, frankly, in my opinion, saying this a generic version of The Dark Knight or The Dark Knight Rises would make me go to hell for bad respect towards some of the best movies ever. Why can't Marvel fix their villain problems, Mandarin was terrible in Iron Man 3, especially that terrible twist. Anyways, I could continue, but you get my point.

Sure they spent a lot on effects and a grand battle scene at the end but throwing money at a movie doesn't help a weak story.This screenplay is weak - it is a overlong with has some rather strained dialog between the leads. The weakest thing about the story is why the evil guy wanted to wreak so much havoc without much reason. It just felt a bit contrived and isn't very involving. Don't feel for any of the characters.There is some wit and humor from Scarlett's deadpan Black Widow and Robert Downey's rather lame one liners.

As technically well-done as the Avengers is in all the action sequences, it lacks any human emotional qualities. Nobody but the most simple-minded that like mindless explosions and destruction will find any interest in this movie. A MOVIE is simple entertainment that will not past the test of time.

Then with some other films in order we the fans have finally gotten what we deserve and that is the crown jewel called THE AVENGERS. This film defiantly deserves the award for most anticipated summer film, best superhero film and so on. If there is one flaw i had to give this film its that this film has an ending to it.

After seeing a screening of the film at Madrid, I can say that The Avengers is The best superhero movie ever made (TM). One of the reasons that make me think like this is that I didn't love all the individual films of the characters.Captain America was right, Thor is average but entertaining and a with an awesome casting, the Hulk only was interesting when the big guy smashed, the second Iron Man was awful.This film exceeds by far the sum of its parts.It is bright, cheerful, colorful. A film by gentlemen in pajamas punching bad guys. Even the Black Widow, totally plain in Iron Man, has a great girl power Whedon style role. It is full of references to the readers, but I swear that every one has a twist that makes them even more fun.Of course, you have some script inconsistencies, and failure to apologize for cursing! Is a comic of gentlemen in pajamas, not The Regent! It has both humor grateful to see the original version and I have no doubt that the dubbing stamina.I wanted to applaud, to cheer... I wish you a experience like mine, with all the cinema enjoying. It is an experience that reminds us that sometimes, just sometimes, a film is much more than watching alone a movie surrounded by other people.Some might say that the Batman movies are better. I would say they are even different genres. Spiderman 2 is the only superhero movie that genuinely, in my humble opinion, can compete.Nobody here is going to win an Oscar, but that does not mean that it can not win a special place in your hearts.And the post-final after the credits ... Okay I expected it. But here we have our final wink, the ultimate gift for those who have spent years reading Marvel comics.

Unlike the first installment, this has nothing but special effects with a disjointed storyline. There are explosions in which most caught in the blast radius would get killed, but leaves nothing but scratches and little or no blood. It's almost stupid, with lines that are supposed to be funny, but are just 'fill-ins' for lack of meaningful dialog. However, the kids in the audience laughed a lot, which made me realize how out of place I was and need to grow up. There will be no next time if there is yet another sequel. Yuck.

As a standalone movie, ""The Avengers"" feels like a mishmash of rapid surface-level character introduction and way too much action. Little attention is given to character development, as it seems viewers are expected to come into the film with a degree of knowledge. However, this is not to say that I think the film would be great if I did have some knowledge of the backstory. There's little in the way of a moral here or a deeper meaning, as this is just a good-GUY-saves-world plot. It's one that (like many superhero movies before) makes me ask if character development or THOUGHT, for that matter, really are being extinguished by money-driven action. I wouldn't even call this a ""popcorn movie,"" as I found few laughs and absolutely no connection to the characters in my experience. I like action movies, but I need to be drawn in to the characters in order to CARE about the action. ""The Avengers"" didn't even try to draw me in, it just said ""here are the heroes, now watch them fight!"" If the first hour had established some human element for the heroes, I might have liked the action. As it stands, the audience is thrown into the arena with the invincible combatants, and expected to immediately feel for them despite their inherent invincibility. I must ask - why should I care about action when one side can't lose and I haven't been told otherwise? Why should I root for the Yankees? (The only reason I can see is because the ""bad guy"" Loki wears a ridiculous looking costume). I keep attempting to find redemption in society's reception of this movie. Maybe that's why I hope that I'm just missing a big part of the backstory. I'm a big Whedon fan, and came into ""The Avengers"" hoping to see some more of his magic. I was rewarded with a two-and-a-half hour snooze fest of CG action. My only sincere hope is that the millions he makes off of this movie funds ""real"" projects of his in the future."

Each of these unique stars brings to the film their own interpretation of a muted, listless performance. I felt Samuel Jackson's performance was especially so: his listlessness seemed mixed with deep despair, an existential disdain so consuming that even feeling disgust would be a comparative relief for him.In the movie a lot of things flew around. There were threats of violence. There was all the drama you'd expect in a Mexican soap opera. There was even an animatronic Gwyneth Paltrow!

I like looking at movies a lot and can enjoy very different genres and qualities, but falling asleep while watching is something I usually don't or cannot do. So this movie -especially in its genre- must be a complete failure. What do I remember after a few days? A bad guy that really wasn't scary, some super heroes that had to fight together to stop that bad guy (and some more I guess), some images of them being on a space ship, and that's it! That's all! What about the end? I'm sure I was awake at that moment of time but I simply can't remember. It could have only been the heroes winning the battle but how and where?

The movie is just fighting, explosions, destruction to infinity, and the action isn't anything that you haven't seen before. There is just more of it, which doesn't make it better - it just makes it become boring and repetitive really fast. Scattered amongst those are retarded dialogs and stupid one-liners, seasoned with terrible acting and corny motivational speeches in the vein of ""God bless America, and make the rest of the world (or rather Universe) its colony."" Samuel L. Jackson was unbelievably terrible, Scarlett Johansson was terrible, and was that Sherlock Holmes wearing a suit of armor? I could have sworn that the character was the same, only the name was different. So much for Robert Downey's versatility. The rest of the cast followed suit. The only decent actor in this movie was Tom Hiddleston , but his character was ruined by the writers. Loki is supposed to be a god, but here he is so mediocre, that it is ridiculous. His ""mighty"" spear is nothing more than a very low grade laser gun, which doubles as a mind control tool that doesn't work all of the time, and when it does work, it does not work all that well. The mighty, fearsome aliens turn out to be mere cannon fodder, dropping like mosquitoes. Characters' level of strength and power changes throughout the movie to suit the need of the moment. There are 2 (yes, TWO) funny scenes, and both include the Hulk beating up people. That should give you an idea about the quality of the funny parts of the movie. I guess to like this one you would either have to be a die hard fan of the Avengers, or a die hard fan of mindless, repetitive, boring action. This movie doesn't require suspension of belief to be enjoyed. It requires suspension of brain functions."

Yes, the special effects were well done, though somewhat inconsistent -- why is the Hulk so huge in some scenes, so human-scale in others?

I would gladly stand in line for another 2 hrs to see it again...The Avengers in one word was ""AMAZING"" Josh Whedon and his cast and crew knocked this movie right out of the ball park and into a whole new cinematic universe !!! The action, humor and story were spot on. The action and characters were ripped right out of the pages and put right onto the screen., everything you love about the comics is there and then some. It was immediately obvious that this movie was made by the fans, for the fans... It dozen't matter if your a fan of comics or cartoons, everyone will find something to like about this movie. Just be prepared for a roller-coaster ride and a a great time at the movies!I have to say when I first heard Mr. Whedon was attached to direct, as a Buffy and Angel fan I was excited., But he succeeded all my expectations and then some. Anyone says you just can't write a good script with this many actors and give them all their own story arc should attend the Josh Whedon school of screen-writing...

121,152,0.68271816,0.26298168,0.05430011,6,Nowhere near what it's cracked up to be,"This movie is the definition of being over-hyped: Hardly any aspect of it has escaped being hailed as among the best of recent years, be it acting, special effects, fighting scenes or plot. In my opinion, it falls far, far short of that benchmark. The visual effects are very good, sure, but then so are the effects in Battleship.The acting isn't bad, but it's hardly impressive either. The few impressive performances are completely overshadowed by the very average writing. Platitudes, one-liners, soundbites and trailer lines are constant. Much of it makes no sense at all: Bruce Banner (Mark Ruffalo) is cautious about ""the other one"" and seems to dislike people knowing about it, yet he constantly references this. It's as if the writers thought ""We haven't shown Banner as the Hulk yet; better make him allude to that in his every line so people don't forget.""The largest problem with the movie, without a doubt, is the plot. The bad guy never feels threatening, his plan is extremely inefficient and frankly stupid in many ways, and the plot holes are too many to count. For instance, in one scene we see the Hulk being a mindless beast, destroying everything in his path, but later we see him taking orders. Add to that that the superhero who apparently has the power of super-aim misses whenever the script calls for it making his on-screen superpower ""is really good with a bow and arrow"". In one scene he misses half a dozen shots from a distance of 12 feet.On a related note, what is Captain Americas superpower compared to the others? Patriotism? Other Avengers are superiour in every single way. Ranged combat, close combat, mobility, intelligence, strength... Even his weapon is a worse version of Thors hammer. Not that Black Widow is any better, but at least she has some use in the plot.This movie is like The Expendables, only it takes itself seriously and has better acting. It is thoroughly unimpressive and how it currently has a rank of #57 of all time movies is truly baffling."

A lot of crappy senseless dialog, a lot of arrogant stupid men in tights, and a lot of senseless action - that is too much for me.

He completes the movie with his shear charisma, the armor he wears is MINDBLOWING!!! The Hulk is an essential character as well, he completes the comical aspect. The Black Widow, this smoking red hot beauty is a burst of adrenaline, Captain America is probably the least noticeable of all. Thor played a really flash, in completing the storyline of Loki. Last but not least the ""Rockstar"" brought to you by AC/DC Tony Stark the witty multi-billionaire playboy is the parallel equivalent to Bruce Wayne. What can we say Folks?

I am pleased to say that 'The Avengers' does not fall into either of these pitholes - in fact, it has to be awarded the title of one of the best films of 2012.The actors were all amazingly casted in their respective roles and do an amazing job of creating intriguing and lovable characters. Many of them were reprising roles they had taken on in previous films - Captain America, Thor or Iron Man, for example - so we already had a good idea of how they would perform, but I feel they all exceeded expectations. Robert Downey Jr was incredible as the humorous yet conflicted Tony Stark/ Iron Man, and Chris Evans was brilliant as the confused, out-of-time Steve Rogers/ Captain America. Mark Ruffalo, the newbie of the cast, stepped into the role of Bruce Banner/ Hulk with great skill and dispersed all doubts as to his suitability. On the other side, Tom Hiddleston really has to be congratulated for his convincing and somehow relatable performance as the villain Loki, whose wit and tricks appealed to fans everywhere.The special effects in this movie were undoubtedly excellent, and despite their need to be ostentatious never seemed unnecessarily unrealistic. The director Joss Whedon did a fabulous job and has created a cinematic classic that will be praised for years to come."

I would give it a 10 out of 10 if Cobie Smulders hadn't been so poorly miscast. Go back to Ted, Robin, you don't belong here. I would be hard pressed to find anything else wrong with this movie.The best scenes are not when the Avengers are working together to fight the enemy, it's when they're fighting each other - with words (hilarious!) or with weapons (bad***!). Some might say the beginning of this movie starts out too slow and there isn't enough action - I'd say they are dead wrong. Dead wrong. This is a movie that doesn't insult the audience by assuming that all they want are things to go crash and boom. This is a movie that cares about developing their characters and cares about an actual storyline. Sure, they're all superheros, but they're all also human. Don't worry though, there's still plenty of action to go around and each of the characters in this movie pulls his (and her!) own weight.My only piece of advice is to first see Captain America, Iron Man (at least the first), and Thor. Especially Thor since the entire premise of this movie is based on Thor's brother Loki - Tom Hiddleston is RIDICULOUSLY amazing in this movie. Avengers does a good job of catching you up to speed if you haven't seen these other movies (or read the comic books, which I admittedly haven't) but I would still recommend seeing them.Bottom Line: If I had the money, I'd be paying to see this movie in the theater every day."

I agree with Rabbi Scott of Houston's Congregation Emanu El, when he described the pleasure he derived from the mesmerized youngsters in the audience as much as his own enjoyment of this super hero film. Robert Downey, Jr. is Iron Man once again, and he gives another uniformly perfect performance. Chris Evans is Captain America, and he too is outstanding as this superman-like individual fighting for truth and justice and the ""American Way"". Mark Ruffalo plays Dr. Bruce Banner/ The Hulk and he too is well cast and successful with his part. Thor is portrayed by Chris Hemsworth, and he too is exemplary with his performance. Of course, there is Samuel L. Jackson as Nick Fury, the leader of this brave crew. Scarlett Johansson as Black Widow/Natasha Romanoff, is very convincing and an extremely tough ingénue in a film which is not directed by Woody Allen. Joss Whedon has written and directed this smash hit in 3D, and I advise that it be seen with this medium, since the special effects are enhanced to the point of overwhelming reality.

The Current rating of 8.9 suggests this movie will be something special. Unfortunately all I saw was something very typical, very Hollywood and very predictable. As more people vote and the hype dies down this movies rating will fall below 8.Don't get me wrong, you will be entertained if you watch it.. The special effects are ... well.. Special. There are even several instances where you will laugh out loud. There are some genuinely funny parts that I wasn't expecting.The problem is the story line is very unoriginal and you're never gripped by what is unfolding. Think transformers. There are just too many clichés, and many instances where things are simply not plausible, even for superheroes. I know it's not meant to be realistic but you will be muttering under your breath ""yeah bull ___ "" at some of the outrageously unlikely feats. Ironman's mid-air ship repair is one particularly bad scene you should watch out for.The acting was acceptable given the script they were working with. It's hard to deliver a line well when it's a god awful cliché. It's the kind of thing where the actor just about looks at the camera and says ""Let's get these guys!"" or ""you're going to pay for that!""

Whedon manages to do it but as a result i feel the story had to fit the characters rather than the characters fit the story. There are a lot of new character relationships that have to be established. It gets a little bit convoluted trying to keep up with itself.The threat facing the avengers, i.e Loki and his rather randomly sourced army, just seems a bit cobbled together. Especially the army! Where they came from or what they are doesn't seem properly explained. Just that Loki somehow has one. The threat the Avengers face seems more to do with sheer numbers of bad guys rather than any particularly interesting powerful individual villains. Loki on his own just doesn't seem that threatening. He is wonderfully without remorse though. Bitter and twisted by his quest for revenge. One of his scenes with black widow is almost like Hannibal Lector and Clarice in Silence of the Lambs.Black widow for my money is the most entertaining and interesting character in the film. Maybe its because she doesn't actually have any super powers that makes her so. What she does have is an exceptional mind, attitude and rather scary hand to hand combat skills. Played wonderfully by Scarlet Johannson she is a pleasure in practically every scene.One of the other pleasurable things about this film is the occasionally very funny dialogue and scenes. Whedon is a master of witty fast paced exchanges and he doesn't disappoint here. The cinema audience laughed hard many times. The Hulk having the two biggest laughs in the film.This is a decent film which could have went horribly wrong. A lot of lead characters vying for screen time is a problem. Time spent establishing new relationships also. Perhaps the next one will be more compelling? The film isn't overly subtle but then what did i expect given the nature of its premise!?"

Surprisingly the script isn't as biased towards Iron Man as I thought it would be and every character gets a good amount of screen time and their chance to shine. Black Widow and Hawkeye more than hold their own and they aren't just in the background whilst the other superheroes dominate the screen and have all the action, Widow and Hawkeye do some unbelievably awesome things, and are crucial to the story. The dialogue is consistently witty and hilarious, every character gets to deliver a good punchline before the film is up. The final battle in Manhattan lasts a good half an hour at least, and I didn't want it to end, the action was of an epic scope and was absolutely jaw dropping. But the real surprise and best part of this film by far is the Hulk. After 2 so- so films they FINALLY got the Hulk right, and dare I say it, he's my favourite avenger after this, and this will probably be the case for most of you when you leave the theatre. This film was action packed, but it wasn't Transformers, this film had heart, intelligent dialogue and a cast of brilliant actors playing conflicting egos and colourful characters. Every actor is spot on in their respective roles, Tom Hiddleston makes for an excellent villain playing Loki, Thor's brother, and Robert Downey Jr. is much better here than he was in Iron Man 2. The only problem I really had with it was that in the middle it dragged on ever so slightly, but this was forgotten by the time the credits rolled. It has to be said though, if you haven't seen any of the Marvel films before this, you won't have any idea what's going on, and you probably won't really care for the film until the last hour or so kicks in. Make sure you stay through the end credits, it's not over just yet!!"

Its exemplary and superior production value, great performance by a stellar cast all portraying iconic superheroes, clever and witty dialogues (albeit with some nonchalant sarcasm thrown by RDJ as the charismatic and philanthropic billionaire with an obsession for high end technology and sophisticated gadgets), superb pacing nary a monotonous moment, adequate and sufficient background information for the uninitiated (those who haven't seen Thor, Captain America, The Incredible Hulk & The Iron Man franchise) but not overly cumbersome in its flashback of the introductory sequences, magnificent cinematography and mesmerizing VFX, profusely suitable background score without unnecessary cacophony and a brilliant, tight-knit plot giving each and every character enough time and screen presence to develop their respective characters, makes this as the best movie of 2012 by far without any hyperbole and on par with Batman:Dark Knight as possibly the greatest Superhero Movie, comprising of a heavy hitting ensemble cast delivering undoubtedly MARVEL's finest effort till date. Director Joss Whedon has done an exceptional and brilliant job. A must watch movie, which is surely going to be an Epic. It's an amazing movie full of heart, gravitas, emotion and depth.

This would be a gem for cinema experience of huge 200 inch TV's but there is a reason these films never gain academy awards genuine ground breaking respect aside from budget and ratings. The point of this review is just an opinionated rant to quarrel with the repetitive plots and average performances that people seem to just eat up and refuse to expand fantastic cinema experience because they're long and to them 'boring' I can state what's boring, A hero is at the height of their average power, suddenly they encounter an ability or change that makes them more powerful and nearly worshiped (Iron Man, Thor, Cpt America, Batman, Spiderman) Now a girl or love interest that comes along and makes them vulnerable or around the time where they become vulnerable because typically, these films have to take their powers away. (Iron Man, Thor, The Hulk, Batman, Spiderman, Wolverine and Superman) Now they are usually hated at this point because they can't protect the masses or their loved ones or are just in doubt if they should pick up their dusty war torn mantle. (Iron Man, Batman, Hulk and Wolverine) And the bad guy is defeated, the girl is usually saved except poor old batman. (Wolverine, Iron Man, Spiderman, The Hulk.) DO you see where I am leading too? Do people like watching the same stuff just wearing a different cape? (metaphore for the smarties out there)I am a fan of Kurbick, Tarentino, Del Toro (whoops I am a Hellboy fan), Scorsese, Finch, Mendes, Aronofsky, Eastwood and Anderson fan among others, and I know the guidelines between a film for fun and a film for what is described as 'moving art' or groundbreaking visual emotion and plot. Oh for a suggestion for some pretty slick action films that have earned respect, try Leon the Professional, Heat, Bunraku and Kiss Kiss Bang Bang (Black Comedy as well)"

I understand that Marvel thought they could forego character development because each character had their own movie (with the exception of the Hulk, as this version is a reboot), I think that there needs to be a lot more going on in order for the characters to be likable. All of the dialogue is either puns, one-liners, or witticisms, as if the movie is one big joke and the actors are constantly winking at the audience. The action and story are pleasing and well thought out, but the characters are completely lacking."

Does anyone care anymore that so little effort and imagination goes into film making? Avengers is 95% CGI, with a plot that is staggering in it's stupidity and unoriginality. Two of the so-called 'super-heroes' have no 'super' qualities at all - unless having funny coloured eyes and firing souped-up arrows or running around in a tight spandex suit showing lots of cleavage and pouting a lot qualify as super powers. All Black Widow does is what Emma Peel did 45 years ago - and half as well, i.e. kick ass. Even worse, the two best and most interesting Marvel characters, Iron Man and Hulk are reduced to mindless morons smashing their way through the enemy and without any attempt at the characterization that previous films did at least endeavour to give them. Every scene and plot twist is utterly predictable, the special effects are boring and the only thing to admire is Samuel L. Jackson'e uncanny ability to find high grossing movie trash to take a stroll through, without making the least effort, and pick up a fat cheque at the other end. Now THAT IS a super power."

The film builds tension during the first two act to culminate in an amazing climax, were the visuals are incredible.It's basically a role model.

It's the kind of movie that left us happy afterwards, that made us want to discuss it at length and made us leave reality; in every sense an aesthetic experience. I loved the action scenes, special effects, and all, but I suppose what I loved best about it were the hilarious one-liners that literally had the entire cinema laughing out loud. There were so many of these, too many to count with my fingers, in fact. There was also one moment when I actually cried, but then that was just me. I tend to cry over everything. *Sheepish smile.*I was initially afraid that so many characters in one movie would result in one convoluted mess, but the writers managed to make a script that somehow gave each character their own screen time without making it appear too contrived, or as though they just forcibly slotted a story in just so a certain character could appear. The entire story actually made sense and flowed naturally into one cohesive whole.I was also initially afraid that so many hunky heroes in one movie would make my heart or brain explode from confusion as to which one to 'ship, as I had fallen in love with each one of these heroes when I watched their individual films in the years past. (Okay, not all of them, just Iron Man, Thor and Captain America.) But here's what I realized - The Avengers makes for an interesting study in finding out what a girl truly finds attractive in a man, depending on who she loves most among the heroes. Is it Captain America, the handsome and wholesome boy next door with the hero's noble heart? Is it Thor, the fierce, masculine man with rippling muscles, facial hair and deep throaty growl? Is it the Hulk, the reserved brainiac with a surprisingly endearing shy smile? Or it it Iron Man, the witty genius billionaire playboy philanthropist (in his own words)?I am not going to recap the story, just go watch it yourself!

The one liners are a keeper, and it comes with some great performances as well, particularly with Robert Downey, Jr and Mark Ruffalo. The film entertains in action, succeeds in comedy, and manages to be one of the greatest films we're bound to see this summer, and potentially one of the best films we'll see of the year.

I don't normally go and see them at the cinema, but someone dragged me along to watch Avengers Assemble.The plot is predictably simple with an alien enemy threatening security on earth. This means that a team of superheroes are required to defeat the enemy. The superheroes that are recruited include Iron Man, Hulk, Thor, Captain America, Hawkeye and the Black Widow. The thing that I disliked about the film is the fact that I didn't really care whether any of the characters survived or perished. There are plenty of funny one-liners in the style of the Bond one-liners. It also appears that the actors had a good time making the film. Scarlett Johansson looks particularly good in a cat-suit throughout the movie.

After watching patiently every superhero movie since the original Superman in 1978 (most of them many times), I realize now that *this* was the one I have been waiting for. To say it was great would be incredibly unjust - there aren't many words to REALLY convey just how special it is. From the casting to the performances to the writing to the fine details to the effects to the dynamic interplay of the characters, this movie is simply hands down the BEST SUPERHERO MOVIE EVER MADE. I wont give any of it away, and there were too many moments to even begin to describe anyway, but I will for sure be going back to see it at least a couple more times (which I NEVER do)and its one of the very few I will for SURE purchase when it is available. Instant classic, and a defining moment for the superhero movie genre. On the way out of the IMAX 3D theater where I saw it, beyond being simply stunned, I had 2 further immediate thoughts: 1) It was SO mind-numbing, and SO far above any superhero movie I have ever seen, that it reminded me of seeing the 1st Lord of The Rings movie (Fellowship) and how I was similarly stunned and literally dazed upon exiting the cinema... 2) I cant for the life of me figure out WHY the powers that be at DC have not yet come out with a Justice League movie in a similar ensemble fashion - their management is asleep at the wheel if that is NOT in development. Anyway back to the movie itself: Go see it, multiple times. You will thank me later."

One other thing ""why would the army build by Loki be of aliens""... thats funny right, why will be the person claiming to be God have an army of powerless aliens with guns and spaceships...The first hour of the movie is a bit drag and feels like the director had to try real hard to put things together to make some sense (which totally did not) and after that what the movie offers in the second hour is not all that great to have waited 1 hour to get to that."

Seems quite a mouthful that.A gunfire underwhelming start with Loki the God escaping with the Cube quite callously provides us with the excuse to get the Avenger cast together. And so follows the tryst with good vs evil. As one scene follows the other in mundane logical sequence, The super heroes flaunt their wares with aplomb.

Or is a movie made just for the Marvel geeks?? But really, I think its just business. For those who seek profound stories, this is not the one, at all. You'll regret for sure if you watch the movie. A considerable huge amount of the film is war, explosions, sound-effects. In not a complete enemy of cinema effects when they are used for good, like Avatar, but, this time is empty from bottom to top. I guess it's just the way of making business and earn a lot of money. It's ironic, after watching the movie (part of it) I started to believe that humans were made to be ruled and submitted, even when we deny it. And loving this movie is the example."

All I can say is that I had a time of my life. It was an amazing film with an amazing storyline and amazing actors in it. When I first heard about the avengers, I was very happy yet skeptical about it. My biggest concern was how they were going to put all these legendary characters into one film and provide them all with enough screen time to achieve some character development. Even after seeing it I have no idea how they did it, but they not only did it they smashed it. Right from the start I was taken to a ride of my life, I could not take my eyes out of what was going on. In terms of special effect, it was top-notch as it was expected no question about it. People are praising this film for being very witty and having a lot of comedy in it, I have to say I am not a fan of comedy, but this film made me laugh more than any other comedy in a very long time. Having to see Hulk smashing Loki or Capitan America patronizing Iron-man, or Iron-Man fighting Thor, was something you could have dreamt of to see on the big screen when you were a kid. But having a chance to see it done and developed in such an effective and spectacular fashion was beyond my wildest expectations, and trust me I had very high hopes for this film. Well, sorry for not being very structured and coherent about the whole thing, I just wanted to share a little bit of joy and excitement that I have been provided with watching this amazing film. It's an epic masterpiece, and seeing it on the big screen is a one of those things you have to do before you die, that's for sure."

Some of the scenes in the Avengers, from the beginning to end, were complete non- sense, very unnecessary, felt forced, lack creativity and almost amateurish. I don't understand the high ratings, and the high gross for the movie, which is attributed to the $50.00 (3D fees) per person. Are some of you people on some kind of drugs? Maybe Inhaling too much theater popcorn chemicals or something? Brain-washed by Joss Whedon? I loved his movies and TV shows, but 1hr and 40mins before we see any real actions? and You guys think it's a good movie? Come on, It's the same crap as the first Hulk movie. By the way, Ruffalo sucks as Banner. Ed Norton was great on the second Hulk movie. Stop sniffing the popcorn chemicals, please!!!"

I watched it yesterday night at the South Delhi PVR Priya Cinema Hall (3D; hated their scratchy defective glasses which needed changing for many people).The first half was just okay (actually even boring) and the intermission point was so ill-timed and then the second half was good. The fight scenes in the city (Manhattan) are like the latest Transformers. A one time watch for sure; but don't expect much. I liked the film but not as much as I had expected it to like! There are many enthralling scenes but the number of boring frames (particularly in the first half) is also abundant. The villain is not so menacing or dignified (like the all-powerful villain of X-Men 3). He needed more teeth. And I am not alone in thinking so; five of my friends with me have similar opinion.

You're a parent, stuck at home with your bored, spoiled brats.
The brats have been badgering you all week to go see The Avengers.
You'll do anything to get out of the house for a few hours.
You'd rather have a dinner out with your spouse, but by the time you pay for dinner and a baby-sitter, forget it. And let's face it, you'll be checking your texts all evening for desperate pleas from the sitter anyway, so you won't be able to relax.
Ultimately you decide, h3ll with it, I'll take the brats to the comic book movie.
So you pile your spawn into the SUV and off you go to the 3D Googleplex.
You pay the $135 for tickets, popcorn, 64-oz cola, and twizzlers, and you sit down to get assaulted by a noisy, pointless, childish blockbuster.
You kids love it.
So next week your spouse has to take them or the kids will tell social services you abuse them.Therefore, if America stopped having kids, Hollywood would stop churning out garbage like The Avengers because there would be no market for it.

Certainly doesn't warrant the current rating on IMDb,"Of all the recent Marvel movies which led to this film, I thought Thor was pretty decent, and the rest were blah. ""Avengers"" is arguably the worst yet.The film reminded me of Transformers 3, with constant explosions and destroyed buildings, as well as ubiquitous 3D scenes which actually don't look very realistic. This movie is a gimmick.The plot is utterly cliché and haphazard. The dialogue, save for a few funny lines, is very bad. No great acting except for Loki, and he seems out of place among wooden performances. Even the editing was pretty lazy. This ""movie"" seems more like a TV serial with forced dialog.The entire film is basically just a vehicle to watch the different heroes fighting with each other."

There are only two things to recommend it: spectacular special effects and the acting of Robert Downey Jr and most of the rest of the ensemble, who make the absolute maximum out of the material. All kudos to them for their fine performances.The main problem for me is with the story, which is absolute dross. What the hell is going on with the flying aircraft carrier, for example? Yeah, it looks great on screen, but in terms of logic there is none. Why are the giant bugs so intent on destroying or dominating Earth? Why are there these Scandinavian demigods running about when everybody knows these belong only to Norse mythology and not to the real world? I could go on but I won't bore all of you who are no doubt going to retort with lengthy explanations of all the ins and outs of the history of the fantasy universe this all arises from. However, viewing this as a stand-alone film, without knowing the extended comic-book background, the events in the film, however exciting, don't make much sense.I'm sorry, I'm not a superhero buff (I admit it, I hate superhero comic books), but seriously none of this guff makes any sense. I'm sure Robert Downey Jr would agree if he wasn't cleverly making a fortune out of the Iron Man franchise. Give me intelligent SF any day."

The movie basically shows that consumers are dumb enough to actually rate a movie high, like the rating is, simply because enough special effects where thrown in their faces to distract from the awful parts.To footnote, only a few directors have actually been able to write and direct their own movie properly and with much success.

So... waste your money if you want at the theater, but I suggest you wait to see it at home. At least you'll have a couch to fall asleep on to get through the middle part. Even the actors seemed disinterested. Captain America had no passion. The King Loki character was awful. Mottling, feeling sorry for himself, no fight, I mean come on! he's supposed to be a King.

You'd never know that the talented Joss Whedon directed -- the film has none of his trademark sly humor, cleverness or pacing.Instead we get a needlessly long film short on everything but action. While Mark Ruffalo is excellent as Bruce Banner / The Hulk, the rest of the cast is pretty much cardboard. Frankly, it's just a dumb film and just because it's popular does not mean it's a good film.So if you like lots of action, wooden dialog, dumb plots, and, well a lot of noise, you'll love this mess of a film. But if you expect to see a film that's better than the best episodes of Josh Whedon's ""Buffy"" or want more from a film, be prepared to be disappointed."

Jackson (who's usually reliable was wooden and had no real take on the character), Robert Downey, (good thing he wore waterproof mascara for his close-ups) Scarlett Johanssson, who needs to go back to acting school, Mark Ruffalo, (what was his take on the part? he just looked confused and lacked confidence), dead spots that almost put me sleep, some very cheesy F/X using miniatures, particularly noticeable in 3D. Lousy photography...the 3D glasses made everything seem dark and drab, I found myself taking them off and seeing much brighter scenes. I'm sure if you're a 12 year old (sadly I'm not) this movie is the best thing you've ever seen, but there are so many other movies of this genre that are so much better on every level (X- Men, and the Batman series in the capable hands of Christopher Nolan to mention two). Captain America's padding in his shirts was laughable (did they run out of CG's, because he looked much better in his own movie). I'm comparing this movie to Avatar because I was also disappointed with that one too, as it relied totally on on special effects, weak story- line, to make it's success. Oh well, I'll look forward to ""The Dark Knight Rises"" because I know Christopher Nolan will not let me down."

This was where they would eventually go. And brother, it didn't disappoint. Joss Whedon's magnum opus boasts more stars than the paramount logo and more capable direction and a more taut script than most of the so-called 'superhero' movies made. The movie featured an interesting mix of Marvel heroes coming together as a team when the Earth is in crisis, to save the world. From a spectacular intro where Loki arrives unexpectedly at SHIELD hq to the brilliant final showdown, 'Avengers' is a thrill ride, never letting go. This is *the* summer blockbuster that people should be lining up to see. Lots of action, lots of thrills, superheroes and and a badass villain. Every scene of the film is dripping with homages to superhero fiction. The one liners are numerous and never seem forced. Iron man's quips are just as well timed as always. Enhancing the action and thrills is the soul of the film which lies in its subtle use of emotions. Joss Whedon has done a remarkable job in adding a huge wave of emotion that runs over the film. Iron man is the machine with a heart, who never shows it. the Hulk is the definition of all heart and no mind to control it. And most surprising of all, Black Widow comes with a beautifully nuanced performance. All hints of fear, love and hatred evident in her subtle reactions. Scarlett Johansson is a casting choice to be applauded, as is Mark Ruffalo since I now cannot imagine anyone doing better justice to the role. The only flaw I could think up was the Marvel universe as such. I don't understand why the X-men weren't considered for the Avengers program (legal rights to the characters issues). But the movie is a wonderful viewing experience and by all means, a treasure. Must see for the summer of 2012."

To be frank, I found all the Avengers themselves lived up to expectations, but the overall storyline and plot was not worthy of the super heroes so many have come to love and adore. The truth is that with so many central characters their opportunity to shine is limited, no matter how well they play their roles. The Dark Knight is, in my opinion, the pinnacle of the super hero genre(so far) and the Avengers doesn't come close. Sorry guys I know I will have offended a few Marvel Maniacs with that comment but it really is true if you look deep enough within yourselves, The Dark Knight is one of the best films of all time, the Avangers is not, plain and simple.

Getting a good balance of all personalities with wholesome and righteous from Captain America, sarcastic and nonchalant from Iron Man, zen and rage from Bruce Banner. They really managed to cover all the sides of human emotion and hero stereotypes.At the end of the day if you want the most unexpected, ground shattering storyline with serious real-life connections tho may not be the best movie for you.

Wow!,"The Avengers, by many people called 'the movie of the year', the epic combination of all the creatures and superheros who have had their own movies during the last decade. One thing is for sure: the film has visual effects. Quite a lot of them. And by 'a lot' i mean A LOT. In almost every scene there's some CGI, whether it's a gigantic Hulk or a flying Iron-Man. Two and a half hours of thrilling action, stunts, huge floating ships, creatures from another world, and more. So I think I speak for everyone who has seen this movie that visually this is one of the best movies ever made. It's a great movie to watch on the big screen in 3D, with a bag of popcorn on you side. The people who created the world of The Avengers have done an outstanding job, it's really overwhelming.But there's so many. So many fights, so many stunts, so many creatures. Al packed into one movie. If you erase all the effects and the action, there's nothing left. The dialog is lame and cheesy, the characters are flat and boring. The plot is simple and predictable, it doesn't leave you thinking and it's certainly not surprising and intuitive. I only cared about the characters because I knew them from previous movies, there's no real character development because the action is the most important aspect of the movie. Yes, the movie has it's funny and shocking moments, but really emotional or deep it never goes. It remains flat and focused on events and action until the (by the way, epic) conclusion.Everything considered, I would say that if you loved the previous superhero movies, and want to see how they come together, and love visual effects, you certainly don't want to skip this one. But don't except a masterpiece, smart dialog and deep emotional scenes. Just lean back, and maybe get another drink."

The story ties itself into knots to rationalize why these disparate superheroes would ever band together, under the supervision of Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson), to thwart the villainous Loki (Tom Hiddleston). Right from the opening scene, a belabored set piece boasting one of the most listless car chases ever filmed, the movie feels off.

I thought that it would be on the same level as the Iron Man movies, Thor and Captain America. Sadly its more on par with the two Hulk movies instead. I have to admit that I am a fan of superheroes but I really wasn't into the Avengers as the cartoons contains too many whiny characters, well the movie is no different. There is too much preaching by Nick Fury, Captain America is too angry (angrier than the Hulk in fact), way too much Tony Stark and too much exposition about science that we really don't care about. The only characters that really shine on screen are Black Widow (wonderful kick ass fight screens, woman with power without superpowers), Hawkeye, Thor, Loki (until he starts getting boring) and Agent Colson. Joss Whedon usually knows how to temper his characters better but in this movie he really put together some awful dialog. Yes some of the jokes were funny but in between there were long periods of just boring stuff. It's too bad I know this will make a lot of money but it could have been so much better.

An all out action popcorn movie that aims to wow the audience with its cutting edge effects, fancy camera work and ability to not have to think, and just sit back. The plot was pretty simple and nothing new in terms of old clichéd, alien guy tries to take over the world with his army and big doomsday device scenario with an ending we have seen a million times before with a ""Lets destroy a city with as much explosions and CGI as possible"" chapter. Don't get me wrong, they did a great job with it. Some of the camera work was excellent, much better than Micheal Bay's close up and shake the camera around everywhere technique. But for me personally I don't like being overwhelmed with all the CGI and the camera taking me away from the characters involvement of the scene and scenario and focusing on the effects. The only thing that kept me going till the end was the humor. If it was not for that I would have rated this film as just another bland CGI bonanza. A good attempt, but for me, not as amazing as everyone is making it out to be. The effect's are amazing, the humor is good, but everything else..seen it before..bored of it."

Simply put Joss Whedon has succeeded where so many others have failed in the past, most notably DC Comics,to bring comic book characters to the real world and the big screen,without alienating the fans or confusing the newbies, and seemingly the hardest task, to make it a good movie. An indication of how he has succeeded is my poor 11 year old daughter, who gets dragged to all the Iron Man, Green Lantern, etc, movies with me and her brothers and she suffers through them quietly (mostly). However after leaving The Avengers she declared it her favourite movie ever. I can't comment on how you would enjoy this movie without the back story contained in the previous Marvel/Avengers Characters movies, but I think that pretty much everyone alive today has some knowledge of who Iron Man, The Hulk and Captain America are, you should be able to work the rest out from there. I saw it in 3D and it was good, but I wouldn't say the 3D is a must. But I would say see it on the big screen, and see it as soon as you can!"

""The Avengers"" (not to be confused with the 1960s TV series) is entertaining enough. It's nothing special - much of it is sensory overload - but it's nothing that it doesn't pretend to be. Loki is the common suave but malevolent villain. He could trick anyone into thinking that he's a decent person. This movie will definitely please the Leonard Hofstadters, Sheldon Coopers, Howard Wolowitzes and Raj Koothrapalis of the world.It was a pleasant surprise to see that one of the people in the World Security Council got played by Jenny Agutter (the nurse in ""An American Werewolf in London"").

I've never disliked Joss Whedon, I love Buffy and Firefly/Serenity but he's not a very good director. The actors seem to suffer as much confusion as their characters do almost like, as torn as they are to join Shield and The Avengers in the film is how torn the actors must feel from scene to scene as to why they're even in this film.Captain America does not seem like a 1930's man, I've seen better period acting in Mad Men and the like, I was looking for some authenticity in him. Thor is paying so much attention to his hair he seems to have forgotten his point. And Scarlett Johansson is horrific, she's so monotonously apathetic it shines through in her character and the only part of her face that shows any sign of acting is her eyebrow, when it raises at one point. The left one it was.And this film is the longest bad film I've ever had the stupidity to watch.Another point that peeved me is that the action is so ridiculously loud but the speaking so quiet in comparison, it was like every explosion was happening inside my head and every conversation was in the next room over and I was listening in.The Avengers gets 1 point for the team dynamic, when they're altogether it's interesting to watch, and 2 points for Robert Downey Jr, he's a whole lot of man but even his humour and acting is outweighed by the stink of the rest of the film, so it gets 3 out of 10 from me and a black mark against Mark Ruffalo who was a credible actor in my eyes."

First of all, right from the first scene I did not understand what was going on. Also, this movie had way, way too much talk, and I couldn't even understand or hear what they were saying. I almost yelled at the movie screen for them to speak clearly. All these random things started happening, and I began to lose track of the storyline. As a result, I fell asleep. The first movie I have ever fallen asleep during, and it was the Avengers. When I woke up, it was the last fighting scene. The same thing seemed to keep happening over and over again, so it wasn't really that exciting. The only thing I got out of that movie was some of Hulk's jokes, which were pretty funny, and Iron Man makes you laugh too sometimes. Other than that, it was only OK. Maybe it's just that I don't like super heroes that much, but I did expect a lot more."

"" There was no scene in the film where I didn't see with my mind's eye the director on set barking stage direction. Perhaps if the script had been stronger, I wouldn't have noticed. But pair a weak script with a long series of obviously staged (and very non-dynamic) scenes, and you end up with more flat scenes than I can count. Character development: With this cadre of fun and interesting actors and the huge budget that hired them, you'd think you'd end up with quality oozing out of the screen. No. Robert Downey's Stark was one- note, snarkie, and that's it. A few fun lines, but zero cleverness and no depth. The same with the rest of them. Except for Mark R. and Scarlet J. They were the only two who created anything interesting with their parts - and of these two, Mark R. created a genuinely interesting character in Banner. CGI: Big budgets mean you shouldn't notice the CGI. In one scene in particular, it was obvious that the actors were in front of a green screen, with the CGI added later. They should blend into the CGI not stand apart and obviously in front of it. Script: Could the script have been more plodding and obvious? It was not a smart or clever script. It read like . . . a comic book! Perhaps that's all Marvel can do well."

We always would love the concept of having all superheroes assembled and fighting for justice and that if such a thing happens, nothing ever could happen to our planet Earth. However, rational thinking would suggest putting them all in one basket would make movie making quite difficult since the logistics of bringing an all conquering villain along with the bonding of the superheroes would change the dynamic of the superhero movie concept and can be a double edged sword if not handled properly. Certainly they cannot make a movie where the heroes are summoned to fight evil and they come and finish the job and they leave. It has to be more complicated than that for the movie to succeed and it is.Hats off to the director and writers of this movie since they not only have a villain who is manipulative, evil and quite powerful with his own army who can provide quite a challenge to the heroes but also have handled well the tricky scenarios of putting all the heroes in the same room. Hulk, Iron Man and Thor are all used to fighting outside of the law as vigilantes in their own movies. These three would normally have no problem working together. The bonding between Ironman and Hulk was depicted aptly since they are both scientists and vigilantes. However, the presence of Captain America, black widow and hawk-eye, who are all used to following orders and work for the law, within this mix creates a lot of tension in the air when they start interacting. The blame games and one-liners are ON and believe me, the one liners from RDJ are really cracking. All this makes for a compelling first half.Obviously, the second half is all about how they work together to destroy the enemy. Its predictable, but its fun and visually awesome as well. Visually its a spectacle and must be watched in 3D. The movie is not without its cons though. For one, I really thought, with Loki as the villain, Thor should have had a better role to play. Unfortunately he was severely under utilized. Scarlett is given an expansive role (I should say her body in that tight fighting outfit is awesome. She is hot) which sometimes even outshines Captain America and the rest.Watch it. Even if its not awesome or amazing or whatever, you will certainly enjoy the ride."

However it took me only 10 minutes of reading IMDb reviews to realise that the waters are clearly divided between Avengers fans and Dark Knight fans. For me I was disappointed after seeing The Avengers however I can largely attribute that to my backgrounds in reading, understanding and writing about complex ideas, something Christopher Nolan's films have drawn out of me. With that said though, the Avengers is a different kind of comic book film. If you're looking for a fun, action based movie for kids then the Avengers is for you. However if you have desires for films with grand ideas, deep characters and complex plots as well as the Batman factor, then the Dark Knight Rises is definitely for you. One thing is certain though, you cannot compare both films against each other. Joss Whedon uses the core elements of the comic series that brought out a very Michael Bay representation while Chrisopher Nolan transforms the comic book ideas into grander social commentaries on moral and philosophical issues while still giving the Dark Knight the attention it deserves. I found the Avengers to be a typical clichè heroes win, predictable, static film something which really takes the sting out of a film for me. I sat through the film realising that the Avengers would come through and win by the way the film was constructed. With the Dark Knight, no one could have predicted the Jokers complex schemes involving Harvey Dent and the way that Batman still beat the joker yet lost the most in the end. That is in my opinion where the Avengers falls short. It's use of poorly developed characters such as Loki, predictable story line and plot, overuse of CG and cliché's give it his rating. Sorry Avengers fans it might be hard to understand but trust me, people who write bad reviews for the Avengers criticizing plot and story are well read and any movie needs a good and dynamic plot regardless of the genre."

I even saw it in 3D. The movie was just as bad, as the trailer looked. The villain Loki wasn't interesting or threatening at all. Whatever happened to a good villain ? The whole story was REALLY, REALLY WEAK. The whole story reminded me very much of Transformer 3, and was just as bad. I don't understand why so many people here praise this movie. If this is supposedly the best super hero movie Hollywood is able to make in 2012: Good night. I don't understand why it is so hard for Hollywood to make a great movie , with a really good, dramatic, epic story. There are so many good comic book stories out there, it can't be that hard to just turn them into a good movie. I was just as disappointed from this movie, as I was from Transformers 3.

If someone tells you different , they may have the mind of a five year old. The action is good and the characters all play their roles great, but something is missing in this movie.If the main villain Loki and his crew of aliens became a threat to any city in the U.S. I would laugh and take my chances. Am I the only one wondering where were the U.S.Airforce ,Marines,Army or even the Navy,when a whole entire city is being attacked ? Who were the aliens shooting at when they came from outerspace ? They sure wasn't hitting the people running around in the middle of the street during the entire battle scene.Did any hardworking bank employee,cop,or other random person running in the street get hurt? I didn't see any. Bad writing and action sequences ruined this movie. I was also wondering,couldn't Thor just electrocute most of the aliens for about 30 mins instead of fighting them one on one?

It's easy, and might as well have a laugh track it's so instructive. From start to finish, the plot carries the same formula - INYOURFACEACTION, comic relief, INYOURFACEACTION, comic relief. Repeat until done. The jokes were painfully predictive and obvious; I felt like cattle being herded along the movie, all too aware of the cheap tricks used to get the audience laughing.

This was the part that I was worried about. Would the story and characters be good enough to match the explosive action? The answer is a resounding YES! Great character interactions, hilarious dialog, a true comic book story (not deep like Dark Knight but fun like Iron Man). All of the characters have roles that feel natural and the dialog flows. Robert Downey Jr getting Joss Whedon lines is as good as it sounds and I never realized how hilariously awesome the hulk could be.There are a few problems I had with the movie such as Captain America's back story, no wait I really just hated the Captain America movie.

However it is truly the story that is most appreciated since it is the final act of an intricate tightly woven plot that has been building through the current generation of Marvel films (Iron Man, The Incredible Hulk, Thor and Captain America: The First Avenger) and ends with the best superhero finale ever conceived for the big screen. Yes its that good. The only factor that could have been reduced was the amount of humour and sarcasm following certain kick-ass scenes which could have benefited with a touch of cool. In retrospect the humour mostly gets it right and compliments the ""comic book"" feel of the movie, which is what we have all desperately wanted for so long: A comic book movie that truly sets your mind free like the comic books and cartoons we all read and watched growing up thinking anything was possible.I applaud you Marvel as ""The Avengers"" now stands as one of the greatest, if not the greatest superhero movie of all time."

Although I felt entertained throughout most of the movie, the lack of depth got to me several times. Don't get me wrong, it's not because the story is bad, as a matter of fact, it's better than most ""we-gotta-save-the-world"" stories involving superheroes. But where The Avengers fails, is when it comes to getting the audience out on the edge of their seats. You never really believe that they actually might fail, and it might be because this movie was aimed at an mainstream audience, that darker themes were left out. After superhero movies like Zack Snyder's ""Watchmen"" (which mixed, ideologies/politics with other deep themes) and Nolan's Batman franchise , The Avengers feels more like a well-made CGI orgy, with funny moments, amidst a story that fails to capture you.

The Special effects are alright, but that's to be expected as they have the budget for it. But to be honest, the only thing that kept me watching this major disappointment was Scarlett Johansson in that tight costume. That's IT! That's simply not enough for a huge blockbuster that was supposed to unite all of these massive superhero movies of late. Don't waste your time with this movie.

What makes The Avengers so Engaging and Intriguing is the dialogue between the superheroes. Joss Wheddon should be awarded with an Oscar for the writing and directing of The Avengers. Everyone blended in so naturally and their back and fourth banter made for some good comedy. Everyone felt equal from Hawkeye to Hulk. It is so difficult to balance these personalities on screen and I don't think any other director besides Joss would've been able to pull it off the way he did.The Action scenes in the Avengers is as Epic as it gets. The last hour is like a marathon of awesomeness. Every action sequence in this movie was perfectly executed and each character had their significant moments. The cast was phenomenal as usual, but the show-stealer is definitely Mark Ruffalo. His portrayal of the incredible hulk was spot on. He was wildly entertaining and I couldn't help but cheer him on when he smashed sh!t. I think what made the Hulk work was because he was used sparingly.Lo-Ki as the villain was great. I felt he was developed a lot better here than in Thor. He was witty and had an evil aura about him especially when he was interacting with the ""mortals"".Never have I enjoyed a movie so much as the Avengers. The 2 hour plus runtime flew by easily and I was left wanting more once it ended. Once in a while a masterpiece of a film comes along, and after the hilarious closing scene after the credits, it was clear that this was Marvel's Masterpiece. Back to the Future and Terminator 2 have always been my go- to favourite movies. After this gem, I believe I can the Avengers to that list. 10/10"

This movie caters to all ages with plenty of laughs and OMG moments. Sure, the beginning had a bit of a slow start, but once it got on its feet, WOW! Iron Man had a big part in this, being the hilarious, immature playboy to Thor and Captain America's more serious nature. Scarlett Johansson played the part of Black Widow perfectly and Hawk-Eye and the Hulk were both splendid. The villain, Loki, stepped out of the ""typical bad guy"" shadow and made the perfect enemy for these amazing heroes. The effects didn't have that sick, CG look a lot of other hero movies have and the plot was believable. I'll admit, I shed a few tears in some scenes, but seconds later, they brought the laughs right back. Overall, an excellent family movie!"

Following the storyline directly from Thor 2011, this movie starts strong with Loki trying to conquer earth, from there its just a wild ride, it grips on you and you won't be able to catch your breath until way after the credits.The thing that I appreciate the most, is that its a true SuperHero movie, often in comics adaptations, the directors try to ground the actions and powers, worried they can not match the scope of the comic book medium. Well, not here, The action is unbelievable, the feats of strength breathtaking Ironman shoots its repulsor beams, Thor uses his lightning strike.Lastly it wouldn't have worked without the humor, Wheedon, has perfect chops, each time his punchlines will take you off guard, and trust me laugh you will.I watched this in a really packed theater, the function was sold out one week before, a record in my country. Everyone was cheering, laughing, clapping and wowing. a truly special spectacle.Really F***ING Amazing."
225,280,0.20135665,0.372559,0.4260843,7,Entertaining. Should not disappoint the masses.,"The Avengers is exactly what I expected. It is action packed, it understandably doesn't have much time for character development (although we do see more of Hawkeye and Black Widow than in previous Marvel installments), and the relentless action is accompanied by some fairly good jokes to ease the tension here and there - especially by Tony Stark and, surprisingly, the Hulk (they actually managed to throw in at least two genuinely funny moments around Hulk's utter brutality).The lack of character development, especially for Thor (who does seem somewhat out of place in this film) but also Bruce Banner, is probably what hurts The Avengers the most. I didn't actually need any character development since I've seen all previous Marvel films at least twice, but it nonetheless does stand as a drawback - it feels wrong even though I was expecting it considering the number of characters already established. I can hardly imagine anyone who hasn't seen the previous films enjoying The Avengers because of that.I usually don't care that much for relentless CGI action films, but some sequences in The Avengers were so blatantly incredible that I had to enjoy them. Notably, a sequence during the huge battle sees the camera pan from one Avenger kicking butt to the other - that was really well done and exciting. Loki was once again a brilliant villain and the perfect choice for the first Avengers film.Overall, a very good action ride bringing our favorite superheros together. The movie doesn't try to be pretentious and goes straight to business - which is what it should do."

Without spoiling anything, I must say it is indeed a spectacular spectacular and I hope to find time to watch it again in the near future. It's an action bonanza laced with fine performances (I love the arguments between Captain America and Iron Man cleverly delivered by Chris Evans and Robert Downey, Jr.), clever humor and not surprisingly Marvel universe references. Anyone who is a comic reader or a Marvel universe fan will notice lots of fine details on the characters, the plot and the images. Even with the daunting challenge of presenting The Avengers as an entertaining all-star gathering, director Joss Whedon cleverly told the story while utilizing the fine talents of the stars. The script was nicely done and the dialogue really reflect the minds of each character. Really, The Avengers is the complete package of entertainment that engaged me with lots of thrills and absolutely no boring moments. I highly recommend it."

Wouldn't go as far to say it was as bad as Transformers 2 and 3 but it was aiming to be.Story wise it was a piece of crap. Typical good vs bad. Acting not so good. The only thing that was protecting these flaws was the special effects. Buildings fell, things blew up, blah blah blah. The end of the movie was meant to be epic but it was very underwhelming. I was thinking that this was meant to be an advanced alien race. I also thought that Cpt America was meant to be a badass but it turns out he wears pyjamas not chainmail.It was memorable... only because it was so disappointing."

To me, that means a plot and story line that I can feel a part of and be interested in what happens to the characters. I pretty much became bored due to feeling no connection with the characters and nothing unexpected happening...sure there are special effects and a bunch of stuff thrown in just to see if it would stick to the wall, but none of it engaging. Then there were characters that were so shallow that I felt no interest in who they were or what part they played...did Gwineth Paltrow actually get paid for whatever it is she was doing? The Hulk seemed to be more of an after thought in this story as there was no consistency in his role. In the Hulk's first scene he's an uncontrollable force that destroys anything regardless of whether it involved resources that belonged to good or evil. The climax of the movie which involves an alien invasion, was far from exciting due to minimal effort being made to compel the viewer into wondering ""Oh my, whats going to happen now"". Instead, the feeling evoked was ""gee, that was an OK special effect""."

First of all, I will say that this film is perhaps the first one (for me ever) that has warranted obtaining it by pirating it from the internet. I could not sleep had I spent $10 at the theater on it, and for that matter $3.00 for a one-evening rental of it on DVD.As I downloaded it, I was really excited, mostly just basing it off the reviews and records it set on its opening weekend and through the summer of 2012 even. And wow, was I so wrong in doing that. Keep in mind, I know that it holds true to form to comic books and their characters depicted in the movie, but I have seen Iron Man, Captain America and the last two Incredible Hulk remakes, and somehow this grouping of all the Marvel characters, diminishes the value of all the characters' individual films they lead in so much its embarrassing. I really liked Iron Man but his one- or two-liners in this film are not funny, but very cheesy and predictable. The costumes on some of the characters are laughably ridiculous, namely Loki his ""ram-looking horns"" or whatever, Hawkeye and his blue contacts and then CGI diminishes all of the others' looks. And finally it speaks enough for itself when this is just one of a very few films I have ever watched where I stopped ( or paused) it every 10 or 20 minutes to go do something else, come back a couple hours later, continue watching,only to repeat the same thing again and again. It took about a day for me to finish it! I mean that just says something of how dull and dopey this film is at times. All the fan-boys who may argue out there, don't please because I obviously realize you are a fan-boy. Anyone else looking for a ""truly good, Oscar-winning, or perhaps classic and one-for-the-history-books"" type of film, look elsewhere."
230,285,0.6357139,0.31055218,0.053733815,8,Avengers Assemble - Review,"There are several reasons why this film fails as something a person should ever watch more than once. Firstly, there is a major lack of plot twists or changes to the story that might keep you on the edge of your seat; everything about the plot is insultingly linear and predictable and follows the most basic structure of 'goods versus evil' with a predictable injection of basic virtue and morals - in this case 'unity' and 'teamwork.' are clearly highlighted.Secondly, the film manages to insult your most basic intelligence by showcasing unnecessary antics that are nothing more than fantastical nonsense. Think of an action scene and describe it in words; this is a way to bypass the lush graphics and realize that: a) while Iron Man is in space and is flying away from the portal, he somehow changes direction in the vacuum of space and returns through the portal. The Hulk, who cannot fly, jumps a few hundred feet in the air and catches Iron Man before bouncing off to safety. b) Nick Fury is violently gunned down, dusts himself down in time to evacuate the base. c) Captain America is shot down, dusts himself down and carries on. d) Black Widow, who also is incapable of flight, gives Captain America psychic eyeballing to communicate she wants to jump ten times her height into the air by bouncing off your shield so I can hijack a space-orcs flying motorcycle which is speeding towards us from a distance.One could argue that it is not meant to be realistic and is mere entertainment. What becomes salient about Avengers Assemble is that there are no rules. The heroes never get stuck, never get challenged, they're never in any recognizable danger, there are no puzzles, any challenge is overcome easily and characters do as they please. No rules means no mystery, no interest and nothing to keep you on the edge of your seat.Finally, the antagonist was hardly foreboding to ever present a sense of danger or worry against so many heroes, all equal protagonists, all dreadfully dull - especially Bruce Banner."

One can see why Buffy & Angel were a huge success, & Firefly/Serenity a huge cult hit. Welcome to the big leagues, Mr. Whedon.As for the movie, I like this movie's Hulk more than the two stand-alone movies. This movie showcases why the Hulk can work best as a supporting character instead of the lead. Hawkeye, in my opinion, was an odd character to add, and the movie could have done just as well without him. The other characters perform their parts well, but Robert Downey Jr's Tony Stark steals the spotlight every time he is on-screen. The chemistry between the cast is seamless. I also loved seeing Coby Smulders as a bad-ass action chick, although its a shame she did not see much action.The only downsides I can think of is the sometimes cheesy dialogs, mostly by Samuel L. Jackson's Nick Fury, and some very loose usage of technical slang.Other than that, here is a toast to The Avengers, and I am surely up for seeing The Avengers 2, Iron Man 3, and (a man can dream) Coby Smulders in an action movie."

The plot, from beginning to end, was important all the way through and must not be missed for the viewer to experience all this movie has to offer.I hope that any other future movie viewers find this movie just as appealing as I did!

233,288,0.019037543,0.14546593,0.83549637,9,A blast from Joss Whedon.,"So here it is. After nearly fifty years, The Avengers have finally made the transition from page to screen, and best of all, it does not manage to disappoint. Much of this is down to Joss Whedon and the pitch-perfect casting.At first, the choice of Whedon as director surprised me somewhat. I really like Whedon, don't get me wrong, but with a background in television and his most notable cinematic efforts being the screenplay for the first 'Toy Story' and the unfortunately overlooked 'Serenity', he struck me as an odd choice. But make no mistake, that even with millions more dollars at hand, Whedon fortunately remains true to himself; keeping humour in sight, with plenty of instantly quotable quips and wisecracks throughout. He is confident and assured with these treasured characters, managing to juggle all these superheroes (and one super ego).We're all used to (most of ) the cast members by now; Robert Downey Jr. as Iron Man, Chris Hemsworth as Thor, Samuel L. Jackson as Nick Fury, Chris Evans as Captain America, Scarlett Johansson as Black Widow, Clark Gregg as Agent Coulson, Tom Hiddleston as Loki; but we also have some new players in the form of Jeremy Renner as Hawkeye and Mark Ruffalo as Hulk. What is most brilliant is that all the actors impress. I was eagerly anticipating seeing Evans as Rogers again, after falling in love with his solo effort, but it was in fact Ruffalo who struck me the most. His portrayal as the tortured Bruce Banner was nuanced, believable and very human, applying emotion to a difficult role. Hiddleston was true pleasure as the villainous Loki, giving a fantastic performance and wonderfully delivering many great lines.One quibble I had was Hawkeye's lack of screen-time, but that can be ignored as I suspect he will either get a spin-off or have a larger role in the sequel. This is the very opposite to say Christopher Nolan's Batman trilogy; instead of being dark, realistic and multi-layered, this is the very synthesis of a big, bright summer movie, a blast from start to finish with humour and large action sequences. While Loki's army were a bit too Transformers-esque for my liking, I still thoroughly enjoyed the film, and exited the cinema with a satisfied smile on my face. Overall, an excellent blockbuster which deserves the praise it's getting. All I want is for Whedon to the sequel."

The story, the acting, the tension, the character relationships, comic relief. Flawless. Just a work of art. I personally think that all of the Marvel movies in the last decade have been great. Movies directed by true comic fans. All leading up to this one moment in cinema history. And they did not let us down:) It's so ironic that most of the ""modern"" action movies are so far fetched. Fake. Pop hype served with sex and a big dose of ""let's come up with a really crazy story to top last years block-buster"". It get's old. This movie, somehow, has a sense of honesty and realism. No doubt, ""super-hero"" magic.

My girlfriend warned me not to get too excited or I would be left disappointed from my own high expectations of it. It was good advice but I simply couldn't help myself. Going into the cinema my expectations were as high as they had ever been for a movie, and yet still I was blown away. From start to finish I was rooted to my seat, with my eyes fixed to the screen. With fantastic visuals, incredible fight scenes and even some witty humor thrown in (some may think this weird but it fits in beautifully). The plot itself is not complex but is interesting and does ""The Avengers"" name justice.Still I think what made this movie so great is the movies that came before it. As soon as the movie starts you already have these characters you know, deep characters each with their own story-line. It means that The Avengers can dive straight in and take you a roller-coaster of a ride. Both those who already know The Avengers from the comics and those who don't will enjoy this."

The movies of the individual heroes were far and away better than the avengers. It just wasn't put together well. Keep making Iron Man's and Incredible hulks, preferably with Edward Norton, and scrap Thor and Captain America. Their boring and too fictitious in comparison to the others.

There is no way this film is even close to a 9 rating (it's at 8.8 or something now) NO WAY.The people who are saying the film is a 9 are most likely hyper teenagers who sit home all day, and don't read anything, and watch reality TV - they don't know what is good and what is terrible.This film is dull. Has no emotion (forced doesn't count), and often times is ridiculous. Though what saves it is the fact it makes fun of itself which is funny. Normally I would rate really low but that humour makes it a little better.It was well done for what it is. But I think what happened is the last few comic book movies (except for batman) were so bad that people were surprised with this one, expecting it to suck. So I read things like this is the greatest film ever, or ""A+"" rating. You have to be joking.One of the things that really gets to me is one part in particular. The HULK Is this un-controllable force. He almost destroys the ship. Makes sense.Then next thing you know he is fighting ALONG with the avengers. UM..HELLO!!?? how the hell did that happen. Oh they magically tamed the beast or something? Banner says ""my secret is I always stay angry"" (something like that) and then turns into the hulk and starts fighting the aliens. This makes no sense.So if he had this mentality all along why did he want to kill everyone on the ship? Nothing was learned. I mean he saves Iron Man later. But on the ship he wanted to kill Thor and others. ????? HUGE GAP. Anyone with half a brain would question this. I enjoy watching this more in cartoon form because the ridiculousness makes sense."

But, if you have watched every previous movie, if you like the characters, then prepare yourself, because Joss Whedon has put together one of the best movies ever made by man!!thats the thing about this movie, its not really a movie on its own, i mean, it expects you to know the characters, and thats just what it has to be. This is not really a movie but a cinematic experience. If the other marvel movies are as getting to know somebody, flirting with that somebody, foreplay, the avengers is sex. Thats the best way i can put it.You can really fell that Whedon knows and loves this characters, because he takes the core elements of each of the avengers personalities and uses them for building the problems, the humor, the companionship. I have to say this is the best team assembly i have seen. This movie has the best humor, the best action, the best acting, the best characterization, the best everything.For the first time, i felt a nerdgasm, I'm not lying or exaggerating, i felt it.Any person who criticizes this movie did not get it at all, did not get the point of it, because the avengers will change cinema forever, i mean it.I love good movies, i do, i know a lot of movies and I'm not a person that watches only Hollywood movies, but i can say this.

These individual films were all very good on their own, so very expectations are foisted on this special film that would unite all of them in one big adventure. Even though I am out of town now, that did not stop me from catching this film with some Marvel comics geeks. And for once, a film has come that fulfills it's advanced hype, and then some!The film follows how these heroes were called together and assembled by Nick Fury of S.H.I.E.L.D. to retrieve a blue high-energy cube called the Tesseract stolen by the Asgard god Loki. It was fun how the film depicted the clash of their individual big egos of the heroes, and they did not really get along with each other right away, as would be expected. There is humor along with the high-intensity action. I felt though that some ""funny"" scenes involving Tony Stark were too self- indulgent for comfort in a ""team"" film like this.It was great to see all of these heroes get their fair share of screen time, even the lesser known ones, like the super-archer Hawkeye (the very busy Jeremy Renner) and the amazing fighter Black Widow (stunningly portrayed by the beautiful Scarlett Johansson). The others played their characters as they did in their solo movies, and amazingly, they all worked so well together here: the imperious Thor by Chris Hemsworth, the patriotic Captain America by Chris Evans and the haughty Tony Stark / Iron Man by Robert Downey Jr. People doubted if Marc Ruffalo could take Ed Norton's place as Dr. Bruce Banner and the Hulk, but Ruffalo actually imbued this character with a unique charm previously unseen in other incarnations. The Hulk received the loudest cheers from the crowd! Even the ever-loyal Agent Coulsen (Clark Gregg) gets his moment to shine.This film is a definite must-see not only for all fans of Marvel comics, but for fans of action/fantasy films in general. This is real triumph for director Josh Whedon.  Don't miss the extra scene included in the middle of the final credits for it will surely get you excited."

It was great seeing Thor and Hulk battle it out again being the last time we saw them together was in TIHR TV movie from 1988!I think it was faithful to the comics and brought the comic strip to life and I can only applaud the efforts of the film crew for bringing together the characters that I grew up and became so fond of."

It may not be perfect, but The Avengers lives up to its promise and delivers quite a punch. I feel The Avenger struggles as most superhero movies do with finding a way to naturally introduce its characters in a way that doesn't seem forced or formulaic. They do a decent job for what it is, but there are certain times you will feel the campiness of older works coming on as you view the film, and truly you just have to sit through it to get to the action that eventually will be at hand. Besides that though, there isn't many flaws. The acting is rather good, Samuel L. Jackson may take a line too seriously or too, but it's all in good fun. Again Tom Hiddleston as Loki is a major standout, and I also enjoyed the return of Robert Downey Jr.'s Iron Man and Chris Hemsworth Thor- as well as an improved performance by Chris Evans as Captain America and a great performance from replacement Hulk actor Mark Ruffalo. The action scenes are exciting and tense, there is some camera angles here and there that can be a bit annoying, but for the most part it is rather clear and not awfully tedious action- as many films of this type could be. In the end, despite its campiness and formulaic actions- The Avengers is an incredibly fun time. It takes pride in its stories and characters and makes the most out of an experience that could have easily been phoned in. Its a film that will live on for some time, and one i'm rather glad I got to experience first hand.My Rating: 9.4/10."

The formula was getting familiar with Captain America but the characters were good so who cares? I was really excited to see where they were going to take these movies. Because no one had ever done this connected thing before and they were slowly taking their time. And it was working!So finally the movie that connected everything was here and the whole world is onboard and watching and what are they going to do? The same old thing. Exactly what they had done in the other movies. Same old generic structure, themes, action, dialogue, jokes and story. Absolutely nothing new. I don't know what I was expecting the comics are all the same too.They don't take any risks or try anything different. And they really went for it in this one by having things happen that don't make any sense. Like in the beginning Banner can't control the Hulk. Then at the end he can? With no explanation? What? Out of all the stuff I see nerds complain about and that actual plot hole goes unnoticed? Then with other movies nerds complain about innocent people being killed? They take out half of New York City! But nobody complains in this movie? I know there's other dumb stuff but my brain forgot about it to make way for useless knowledge of good movies.I understand these movies being big for boys under 17 but come on? So many people plug their nose and swallow this mindless crap without question. And Disney has the power to do anything that they want and they don't use it. They don't try something new. They use cheap tricks to make movies satisfying on a cheap emotional level to get people to enjoy them. And they have dominated the box office for 10 years and they aren't using that responsibility to do anything good. They could be getting a great message out there but no. Same old crap. Why because it works. And they'll only do something new if someone else does it first.Didn't they have Black Widow around forever? And when did they decide to give her here own movie? Oh yeah after DC made Wonder Woman and it was a huge hit.This was really the beginning of Disney ruining the blockbuster. And somehow you tools let it happen. You just kept going back getting fed the same old crap again and again."

I came to this film with virtually no background in the Marvelverse, so I was a bit confused at first. My husband helped fill in the blanks by stopping the film when I had questions, but I have to admit the script did a good job of filling in the blanks minus a few details. This is an excellent film of its genre that incorporates everything special effects can do today with great character development, courtesy of Joss Whedon who wrote and directed this blockbuster masterpiece. Do you know how rare it is to have blockbuster and masterpiece in the same sentence? He has to know that at some level that he, once again, did the impossible. He took what could have easily been a disaster and he produced gold. He created a movie that was fun, and exciting and shaped and brought cohesion to the Marvel Movie Universe and gave each character their time to shine. It has great acting; quippy dialogue; tons of very well done action; and a decent, if underplayed, level of ambiguity to the morality of the characters. They worked individually, they worked collectively. It had lots of Ultimate Alliance moments. Hulk shoves a piece of armor into the giant worm and Thor hammers it into his head, Thor brings his hammer down on Cap's shield and causes a huge shockwave, Thor shoots lightning at Iron Man and causes his suit to boost up to like 400+% giving him a supercharged shot. I love that all of those moments were added. I also love how Joss had a bunch of the heroes fight each other in a way that made sense in the context of the movie. Thor vs Hulk, Thor vs Cap, Thor Vs Iron Man, Hawkeye vs Black Widow, Black Widow vs Hulk. You can't help but love each and every fight. Will people still be talking about it 80 years from now the way they talk about Citizen Kane? Probably not. But Whedon accomplished in the 2010's in making a film in which I was completely engrossed for two and a half hours, had a wonderful and fun time and wondered where the time had gone when the credits rolled. And isn't that why we go to the movies in the first place?"

However, Robert Downey Jr puts in a show- stealing performance.On the whole, vastly over-rated (and this is probably a sign of how dumbed-down the general population is with regard to expectations for movies).

It is NOT an original plot or even creative. I fail to see how long scenes of fighting, with the camera cutting back and forth is entertaining.

(Samuel L. Jackson)-who are called upon to battle evil Asgardian Loki (Tom Hiddleston) when he threatens to invade the planet with his Chitauri army.The Avengers made an absolute mint at the box-office, proving to me that a large percentage of cinema-goers aren't all that fussed about an innovative or intelligible script just so long as they get plenty of bang for their buck. Written and directed by Joss Whedon, The Avengers Assemble (as it is known in the UK) is an unnecessarily convoluted superhero blockbuster wrapped around the most tired of premises: an evil being seeking a mystical energy source that will give him the power to rule the world. This trite set-up allows for countless effects filled battles during which no-one suffers anything more than a bruised ego.An impressive line-up of Hollywood A-listers and the most spectacular state-of-the-art CGI effects money can buy do not alter the fact that this is predictable, clichéd nonsense told with little style, coherence or originality."

My first biggest problem with this movie: Mark Ruffalo was HORRIBLE as Bruce Banner! It was like he was sleepwalking through the entire movie! Marvel fired Edward Norton, and the best replacement they could find was this guy? Did they just pick his name out of a hat? Come on! My second biggest problem with this movie: Captain America gets pushed to the side, and most of the focus is on Iron Man. Why?! Here's a crazy idea: Seeing as how Captain America is the LEADER of the Avengers! Why not give him the spotlight? Furthermore, Iron Man and Captain America hardly ever get along in this movie. This wasn't at ALL like it was in the comics! In the comics, Tony Stark deeply admired and respected Steve Rogers. In Fact, Tony Stark's father, Howard helped create the ""Captain America"" program. My third biggest problem with this movie: It takes FOREVER for the The Avengers to come together and work as a team. Throughout the movie, all they do is fight most of the time, and occasionally throw in a corny joke. Can someone please tell me what purpose that serves, other than to look cool?

When I finally got to see the movie I realized after the first 20 minutes that this wasn't the movie I was hoping for. Now let me explain why.I can start off with the script. The script is not good, by adding some over-dramatic, cheesy and boring dialogue doesn't make a movie good. But the script isn't terrible, some of the cheesy comments fits with the dialogue and makes you laugh a little. But the one thing that is directly terrible with this movie is the story. For those of you who don't know the story, it goes like this; Thor's evil brother Loki has come to the earth to claim it as his, and then he gets a thing called the Tesseract, and afters that he opens a portal so his alien army can enter the earth to take control over it. But then Nick Fury brings together the superhero team called ''The Avengers'' to stop him. I don't think it's necessary for me to start explaining why the story is so terrible, most people should understand why. And I know a lot of people have claimed that the film don't need a good script or story because it's so entertaining. Well, I don't agree. The first 1 and a half hours of the movie is really boring, and I actually considered leaving the cinema, but then the movie catch up with some really cool and visually stunning scenes. Some things in this movie was good, like most of the acting, the CGI and some of the dialogue. But overall this is just an average popcorn movie with a superhero flick."

For example, Spiderman 3 had chunks of useless segments and a plot shamelessly recycled from earlier Spiderman movies, interspersed with some gorgeous moments of action. This one is interesting. It wouldn't have been as effective without all the introductory movies for many of the characters, including Captain America, Iron Man and Thor, which actually set the table for this main course. The collection of heroes make this movie greater than the sum of the individual works, it just fits like a glove. There are so many good performances - Evans is good again as Capt. A; Downey has made Iron Man his own, and he's got most of the best lines; Ruffalo is amazing as The Hulk; Johannson is solid as the Widow; Jackson and Gregg fit as Nick Fury and his top agent; and just maybe Renner trumps them all as the unflappable Hawkeye. I saw this with my youngest in 3-D, the next night I went back with both my kids and saw it again in 3-D and enjoyed it just as much. Hiddleston does an admirable Jaye Davidson-esque turn as the bad guy, with some help from an other-worldly invasion force. The CGI stuff works, interspersed with some eye-opening live action. The best moment comes when the camera does a slow 360 degree circuit of the Avengers circling the wagons in NYC. There's a lot going on here, and there still is some fat mixed in with the meat, but as a whole this thing just works grandly. Very highly recommended."

The acting is so perfect and the plot was also amazing. The action was unbelievable and the effects were outstanding!!!! I love this movie and have high respect for everyone involved in the making. The Incredible Hulk was portrayed exactly as he should be, just pure rage and outbursts of anger. The Iron Man was super funny and really cool too, as always. Captain America isn't my favorite, he's kind of lame. Hawkeye is also very cool, but I wish he had an actual superpower, like agility or something. Black Widow is awesome, but she wasn't used to her fullest abilities in this movie. Thor is also very cool, but should have been used a little more in this movie.

SO: This movie is entertaining, if you like lots of CGIs and action; there is NO Original/Surprising story. The acting is good (they brought GOOD Actors, you wouldn't expect less). We laughed twice (The Hulk character provided the much needed relief). You will enjoy it on a big screen. BUT THAT'S IT. 8.6? Really? How many times you can watch Manhattan destroyed?!

I gave it a 5 to lower the expectations of people who go to watch a movie on the big screen,instead of watching it @ home.If you like CGIs and a predicted plot it deserves between 6-7.

Jackson) hint at the upcoming film.The film itself has certainly lived up to the hype, the cast is superb with an all star cast including; Robert Downey Jr., Chris Evans, Scarlett Johansson, Chris Hemsworth, Samuel L. Jackson and Gwyneth Paltrow. It also includes new up and comers; Mark Ruffalo, Jeremy Renner and Tom Hiddleston.In the very beginning it is quite dull but it gets progressively better and better as it goes along! The cast all work together really well and there are tonnes of laughs and shining moments! Robert Downey Jr. (Iron Man/Tony Stark) is definitely one of the shining stars. Downey Jr. and Johansson were the best of the bunch; they both did some fantastic acting and were absolutely hilarious! Chris Evans (Captain America/Steve Rogers) annoyed me because his character is very cocky and relatively boring yet he got quite a lot of screen time?The film has its up's and it has its minor down's but overall the film was fantastic and I really enjoyed watching it, I'm sure there will be a sequel, here's hoping it's as good as this!"

I just think the story line was lacking and some characters was not up for this job and should have been left out like Samuel Jackson (Nick Fury),Clint Barton (Hawkeye) and Loki looked weak and his pointy scepter he had was a ridicules prop that appeared weak and fragile. The rest of the cast was excellent, especially Iron man, Black Widow."

We watched this movie knowing it was going to be a superhero flick so was basically going to have a lot of action scenes and naturally it's going to be full of CGI. Also I expected some one liners that would be witty and corny. If you expected anything different then your previous superhero movie experiences may of been categorized a little wrong. All up it was a great movie and lived up to my expectations which is usually not the case. It was a longer than expected movie and probably could of been shortened a little in the first half but all was forgiven once the heroes started showing off their skills. Some great witty humor, some lines a little corny. The storyline was not too predictable either. Unless of coarse you feel the superheroes saving the day is too predictable. I left the cinema wondering when the Bluray release date will be and debating who the ultimate superhero really would be."

Robert Downy Jr., as usual, brought the most amazing array of sarcasm and wit to the screen, his audacity always has just the right amount of pluck and pomp to press all the right buttons while tip toeing playfully on all the wrong ones.

Believe me, I think the LEGO sets based on the film are more interesting and the mini figure of Thor is better than the one in the movie because he can't talk.

LOADS of CGI but the action was intense AF. So at the end of the day, it's entertaining. I couldn't watch it 5-6 times, but none the less entertaining.Now for those who can't seem to understand how ratings work. Was it the best movie you have EVER saw? No? OK, don't rate it 10/10. Was it the worst movie you have EVER saw? No? OK, don't rate it 1/10. Simple. And for those expecting some original, new, fresh plot and amazingly moving dialogue. Seriously?

It's simply a blockbuster action-movie with superheroes. The plot is easy to follow; bad man wants to take over the Earth for some reason, gets help from aliens to do this, superheroes stop him/them. Of course, this is a bit general, and yes I know the names etc of all these people (beings?). Having had separate movies for many of these heroes (Thor, Iron Man, Captain America, The Incredible Hulk), we know these superheroes, their character and motives if you will. Not all the audience will have seen the previous movies, but it's not exactly a difficult story to follow, and we have seen the same plot 10000 times before, in different variations and in different mediums (books, comic-books, films etc).You guys could see the movie or read about the whole synopsis right here, because I can't bother telling it in detail. Anyway, point is this; if you want to see a summer, blockbuster action-movie with lots of eye candy, then you have discovered the right movie. It's fun, enjoyable and with lots of action, naturally. If you're looking for a great story though, you might have to look somewhere else. There's really no surprising twists or complexity, no fear for the well-being of any of the characters, and in short, not a really interesting story to tell. All the action-scenes are fun etc, but if an alien species invaded us, I would assume that they would have more potent weapons than some laser guns and huge fish-like robots that crash into buildings in Manhatten. Really, a demi-god like Loki and an advanced alien species are content with ravaging Manhatten a bit? Seems like we humans have better weapons alone in the atomic bomb, because one of those was enough to stop them. Yeah, and we have superheroes, three of which are severely underpowered and I don't understand why they were even there (Black Widow, Hawkeye and Captain America). Lame. Enjoyable and fun to watch, but bad story. Should get around 6-7 IMDb rating. Simply because it's a well-made action-movie blockbuster. No way this is among the best movies ever made, as it stands now in the IMDb ratings."

Needless to say, The Avengers is everything you want and more in a superhero blockbuster flick. MARVEL truly put a lot of effort into this movie and it really does show a lot. They not only did a huge team up movie, but they also created one that was deep, compelling and brilliantly done. Every hero we've seen in this movie is given not only a fair amount of time on screen as a group, but each one also individually. We see their struggles with their times as a superhero and each one of them has an arc of their own. Even some of the side characters get their own fair share of screen time and I for one applaud that. The action scenes are beautifully well done in this movie and some of the best I've seen in a superhero flick; especially the final battle. Not only does this movie succeed in also being strong in character development and action, but its humor is also top notch. I burst out laughing at a lot of those funny moments and I think you will too when you see them. There is a lot of eye candy to behold in the movie as well and everything looks brilliant and feels brilliant. I'm not going to go into more of this movie so I don't dare spoil anything for you all, but it has to be said right now. The Avengers is quite possibly the best movie of 2012 I've ever seen. The story is excellent, the characters are superb, the effects are top notch, there is plenty of funny moments, and everything in this movie is well balanced from beginning to end.

Also, if I'm being completely honest, I went in assuming it would be another highly overrated superhero movie that couldn't like up to the hype. It definitely wouldn't be the first time I disagreed with the critics. Boy was I mistaken. Outside of the films from Christopher Nolan's Dark Knight Trilogy, this is easily the best superhero movie ever made. They plot developed perfectly, the action sequences were incredible, there were a lot of unexpectedly humorous scenes and dialogue, and the characters and actors were all great. One of my concerns going in was how they would possibly give each character their fair shake. Well the great Joss Whedon did a great job keeping a perfect balance between staying true to the individual characters while further introducing a developing Black Widow and Hawkeye. Another thing, Mark Ruffalo did a marvelous job as Bruce Banner. A lot of people were worried about him in that role and were upset about the change from Edward Norton. Maybe it's because I'm biased and loathe Norton but I thought Ruffalo did a better job as Banner. I wouldn't have minded them focusing a little more time on the Hawkeye character and I wouldn't have minded if they actually squeezed in Natalie Portman's character for a quick scene or two but the movie really didn't need it. I just think if you can put Portman on screen, you put Portman on screen, lol. I also wouldn't have minded if they focused a bit more on the villainous pawns and where they come from but I have a feeling we'll find out more about them in the following Avengers sequels so I can't be too upset about that.

Apart from that(because Captain America is one of my heroes) i can't give a 9 to this movie, all the scenes are great, Loki isn't that good as everyone says here, a god doesn't spit to a glass while talking, you don't even know if gods have saliva, it's not cool, but anyway i think it deserves a 9.5. Because i can't give that, and, although it doesn't respect Captain America spirit right, it's an awesome movie, 10 stars!Best part of the movie is the scene when Hulk starts fighting the bad guys, you won't get better excitement and thrill then this, not even on the Hulk movies, what a shame for those two..."

The Avengers is better than all of those. All of the heroes in The Avengers get a moment to shine on screen, even Nick Fury. Going into the movie I was a little disappointed to know that Loki was going to be the main protagonist, but after seeing the film I can see why this was the case. The Avengers ties a lot of the previous movies together, and having Thor's brother as the bad guy made that more efficient. It's a long movie, but when it was over I didn't feel beat up and ready for the story to be over the way I do when trying to watch an entire Harry Potter movie. Even the Lord of the Rings movies seems too long to me, but thanks to a great story and even better dialog I never became impatient during The Avengers.The standout from The Avengers is clearly The Hulk. You spend most of the movie waiting for him to appear and it's amazing when he finally goes on a rampage. At two points during the movie The Hulk actually got applause from the audience.Highly recommended, I can't wait to see it again. Let's hope The Avengers 2 is half as good!"

I'm a big fan of the spider-man trilogy, love Iron man (at least the first one) and could even enjoy Thor (being from Sweden who wouldn't right?). Thor was definitely best served hung over and gave me exactly what I expected, the Avengers did not. I don't know where to begin with this movie, it's just one of those where you die a little inside every time a punchline is delivered. Alright, Samuel L have earned his right to do just that, but the rest of them have not. It's extremely predictable, you see everything coming from miles away. If you're expecting a great story you would do best to rethink your choice of movie. There is way to many heroes, the story becomes a messy tangle of too many stories and the only one making me laugh is Stark (Iron man). Also they all seem to have the same strength all of a sudden. Don't get me wrong, I'm not one of those guys getting annoyed by the impossibility behind superpowers, but this is absurd.

Black Widow and Hawkeye also have their time on the screen. But of course the best lines go to Iron Man and the most epic fight scenes go to the Hulk.After watching the two Hulk movies I was a little disappointed only to the extent that they show him as this destructive and out of control monster which he is. But this movie makes you sympathize with him and even make you like him. In fact I felt that the fight scenes involving The Hulk were the best in the whole movie, followed by Iron man! I won hide the fact that I am a huge Batman fan, I find Nolan's movies head and shoulder's over other movies, but this movie is up in the same league. Highly polished character screen presence, well directed, amazingly witty, very very funny and above all visually captivating. I felt the run time was a little short actually. I just didn't want it to end. Considering people were clapping and yelling out their approval for some of the movie's topnotch scenes this movie will be a huge blockbuster which it thoroughly deserves to be. I am predicting it will be the next 1 billion grosser!!! This movie just raised the bar to a whole new level for Marvel movies. Seriously I was more eager for the release of The Dark Knight Rises but wow! What a show by Marvel and I would say full credit to Joss Whedon. You sir are just outstanding... The movie was tight and it didn't have any loose ends worth mentioning. First my favorite series of all time Firefly, now this, thank you, Joss Whedon!!! That was a mind-blowing movie.

The movie is heavily based on the power and skills of IRON MAN and later followed by Hulk; all other characters are just supporting characters adding no extra flavor to remember. Since Captain America, Hawkeye & Natasha don't have super powers they lacked the status of being a superhero as far as avengers is concerned. Even the possibility of emotional connects between Clint Barton (Hawkeye) and Natasha was missing. Also Steve Rogers(Captain America) was struggling to make a presence with other super powers.If one has to term The Avengers as Ironman 3 than it would not be possibly wrong because from the beginning to the climax it's he who holds the film either by his action or style or the dialogues (some of them are really cool). The auto removal of his iron-suit by robotic machines was kool and in a scene where Loki pushed him from the heights, the way his Iron suit came, auto activated and became his body-suit was awesome. Thou Hulk was entertaining but he came into his 'Smashing Avatar' only after half the way movie has past. The way he beaten up the 'Loki' after his comments of being a God was really enjoyable But Joss Whedon, the director could have done better to balance out the movie in terms of introducing equally capable superheroes. Also first half of the movie gradually reaches to boredom with the introduction of superheroes; it's only in the second half that excitement moved to the next level. When we talk about visual effects, cinematography, production value, 3D version or soundtrack all are good and worth praising. Regarding performances its again all the good humor punches goes along with Ironman which makes you smile followed by Hulk. Tom Hiddlestone as Loki and Scarlett Johansson as Natasha were impressive. Rest all were limited in role to mention.Overall it's a good weekend watch especially for Ironman and Hulk Fans but may not live up to the hype created. Walt Disney is gradually learning to tap South-Asian markets by pre releasing the movies here after the debacle of John Carter(thou a good movie) ;Hope this will worked out.Thanks & Regards AVA TheCritiqueLab.com"

Importantly, these movies were conceived, from the very start, as essential building blocks moving towards this film, which achieves a cinematic first by bringing together a number of characters who have headlined their own movies and who now appear together (OK, so I'm ignoring Abbott and Castello's role in bringing together Dracula, Frankenstein's Monster and the Wolfman. So sue me).The problem was always going to be how to deal with bringing together such powerful characters in a team movie when every one of them is a strong enough character to have carried his own movie - surely either they are all downgraded to sidekicks of each other? Or else the movie will be nothing but a testosterone-fulled p*ss*ng contest? It turns out that it is both these things, but the mix is beautifully judged. By entrusting the script and direction to Joss Whedon - ace script doctor, master at working with ensemble pieces, and lifelong comic lover (and excellent comic writer, one might also add), the balance - for balance was always going to be critical in this movie - is perfect.I won't say anything very much about the content, because there is so much in this movie to enjoy. It is simply full of small touches among the bombast, which will bring delight to the average viewer who likes an action-packed blockbuster, and absolute joy to comic lovers. The characters which have been established in the previous movies are all here, and they are all the same people - they haven't been changed for The Avengers, but they have more depth and there is also character development here. The script is terrific and the action is stunning. Oh, and hang on until after the main titles have finished at the end...By the way, thank you so much for saddling this movie in the UK with the ridiculous title ""Marvel Avengers Assemble"" (which communicates even less to a non-comics audience than ""The Avengers"") and also depriving us of the iconic Avengers logo and title on the main title screen."

I'm not much of a superhero fan, but I did enjoy Spiderman 1, 2, and 3 as well as Ironman. I've never seen Thor or Captain America so I know I'm missing a little backstory, but I doubt it would add a lot to the experience in this movie. The story was sub-par and very predictable. There is also no sense of danger whatsoever since these superheroes are near invincible, which is why I tend to avoid superhero movies. Action scenes are therefore boring because you know the outcome 99/100 times. I laugh at why they even bother shooting guns at these guys. Do they really expect us to be on the edge of our seats? Yes, the visuals are decent but that's not what makes a movie. When comparing this film to Guardians of the Galaxy, it's no contest. GotG had drama, humor (that wasn't forced), a decent story, and fantastic visuals. If you are a Marvel fan, you will probably like this film simply because you love the characters.

But i was wrong, what happened when the film started was a collection of events that changed my ""little hope"" attitude into something much different. After the opening scene i was, to say the least, entertained. But, when i tasked myself with the painfully easy job of rating this film, all this film is...is entertainment. In a time of dazzling CGI and insanely fun action sequences, The Avengers lives up to the hype. But in a world of intriguing plot, immersing performances and emotional roller coaster rides, The Avengers is nothing but another Transformers movie. Let me elaborate. Fans of the Marvel Comics will love this movie, because it does what it says on the tin, it effectively brings the heroes (not all of them, but some) together in a fist fight with a destructive foe. To a Marvel fan, this is gold. To a ""film"" fan, however, this movie is little more than a popcorn flick. People enjoying this movie is not my issue, i want people to enjoy movies, but when it comes to the rating systems on IMDb and Rotten Tomatoes (etc) people have, wrongly, rated the Avengers near to the highest of all ratings. Films like the Godfather, ALIEN, Shane, Vertigo, Psycho, Blade Runner, Goodfellas, Jaws and many, many more films deserve the high rating because these are cinematic masterpieces. These are films which changed cinema, and have set the benchmark for all genres of today's films. But when i see The Avengers at the top of the ratings with them, it disgusts me. It should be rated fairly, on an accurate basis of how the film is crafted and the impact it makes, and for me it is a 4. Don't get me wrong, this is not a bad movie. But, it is not a classic, nor by far a masterpiece, which renders most fans reviews redundant. People can love this movie, hell it can be there favorite movie of them all, but they need to understand it is nowhere near the Giants of cinema. Its not worth all the hype, but its fun. Its not a clever film (the themes have been done to death, and the twists are terrible) but its entertainment.So, i bid you farewell."

This is a whole team of heroes working together.Because of its timing, this will be compared to The Dark Knight Rises. Most seems to give TDKR more credit because of its darker grittier tone. Both are great but I like Avengers better. Honestly, TDKR is inferior to TDK. There are logic problems with TDKR. There are too many comic-book moves in that film. It's melodramatic in its emotionally manipulations. The Avengers is simply better written. Its dialog is better. It may be simplistic but it's more fun."

It's delightfully funny. I like these people. I like this story. I love with that Romanoff girl. Mark Ruffalo is great. He is just great. It's balanced. It cannot be easy to portray superheroes but they pull it off. You know they must be up against green screens but I believed it. The writing is fantastic. I can quote lines. My friends can quote lines. Everyone has a favorite scene. I have second third and fourth favorites. It's fast paced but you get to know the characters. I want Hollywood to know if I don't care about the characters I don't care what happens to them. I have almost no memory of ""The Grifters"", because yuck. I like movies with nice characters. And it's colorful. Did you see ""The Ledge"" it is so drab they could have saved money and filmed it in black and white. You're stuck in Baton Rouge, dude just jump, gees. Did you see ""Cloud Atlas"" visually spectacular. That's all it's got and still I'd give it about a six."

It had lots of action, but the plot was a little weak. I also didn't understand why they took the villain from Thor and couldn't use someone like Thanos (which is rumored to be the villain for the sequel). Yeah, it had lots of jokes but most of them were too cheesy for me. The best jokes come from Iron Man. It gets a bit boring in the middle part. Overall, I don't think this is a bad movie but I don't think it deserves a spot on the top 250. You should also know I almost never give movies a 10/10. Also the fan base for it is a bit annoying but I should leave that out. The plot is basically a bunch of middle-aged superheroes coming together to fight one of the superhero's brother and his army of Skrulls or Chiatauris if you will. Ruffalo's performance as the Hulk was the best out of any of them, unfortunately there is no Hulk sequel planned for MCU: Phase 2. You should also now know that I've watched all the MCU films and own most of them on DVD. Overall, 8/10. You should also know that I don't hate Marvel and I love them over DC except when it comes to movies."

Not just an exploding good time but a legitimately good film. It's well written, has character and plot development, stunning visual effects, fantastic action sequences, and most importantly, the avengers themselves. My favorite thing about the introduction of the characters is that they don't all appear at once. The avengers come together one at a time planning to accomplish their own goals at first, only discover that they all have a common enemy and the world needs them. It's a smart and good pace that the film follows allowing the audience to breath a little. The cast acts their parts in a way that comic book films almost never succeed in. They have dynamic and rope you in every second. You can even put aside Captain America's dorky costume because everything about this movie is so good. Best part? No romantic crap in this movie. Everything is short, simple, and to the stuff we care about."

Normally in films the bad guy actually comes somewhere close to winning or at least gives the ""heroes"" some trouble. In this film Loki seemed weak and powerless compared to the heroes. Most of the main characters weren't needed like Black Widow, Hawkeye, Thor, and Captain America. The same results could have been achieved if the Hulk and Iron Man were the only heroes. The ease that the Avengers had in defeating Loki made the film boring and regrettable to watch. I found myself on the verge of falling asleep during this entire film.

In fact, like it happened in so many other films boosted for 3D, the lighting is too dark. For the rest, the movie is as funny as the first Iron Man movie. It's made with serious, but tongue-in-cheek humour. The cast in incredibly laughable. All the main characters are played by great actors, which is helping to support all the non-sense parts of the script. The craziest one is certainly Mark Ruffalo who's playing David Banner, a.k.a The Incredible Hulk. The man is always angry, and it takes a long time before we could see the deepness of his anger. But the waiting is good. The first part of the movie is just too slow, it takes too much time to start. As if the authors were trying too hard to explain every links with all the other Marvel movies made before. It's not always useful. It's nice to see some more great actors like Jeremy Renner, Mark Ruffalo and Scarlett Johanson to join this team."

Unfortunately, in practice I couldn't wait for this movie to end.From the empty backstory for the 'bad guys', to a total lack of empathy for any of the main characters, I found this whole experience soul crushingly dull. Which is odd when there's an explosion or a fist fight every 5 minutes.It would be quite annoying to work out the veneer-thin plot if not having seen some of the prior Marvel outings for Thor, Iron Man, et al, but there are some saving graces.An almost seamless set of special effects does lend a sense of realism to the ridiculous scenarios that the heroes find themselves in. And with plenty of running time to allow each a fair chunk of screen time, it doesn't feel as if any one member is worth less than the rest.That's part of the problem for me- with trying to squeeze an equal share for everyone in, it starts to feel patched together, losing coherence. When the flow begins to break up, my attention span begins to shorten. I start to not care about the events or their impact on the story, and instead just want to see the Hulk smash."

I'd loved all the other Marvel movies leading up to it, so I was really stoked. The Avengers is the superhero movie we've been waiting for. Don't get me wrong, I love the darkness of other superhero movies, like The Dark Knight, but as Nick Fury aptly puts it: ""maybe we need a little old-fashioned"". And this movie is exactly that. Joss Whedon gives us precisely what superheroes used to be - extraordinary people fighting their flaws to become the saviors of the human race. In all fairness, The Avengers is not a film that requires much thought. It's a beautiful spectacle, but it definitely does not possess Oscar-worthy performances. It's slightly campy and tongue-in-cheek, which is oddly refreshing. The Avengers never takes itself too seriously, which I think a lot of people aren't getting (hence some extremely scathing reviews on here!)With the exception of Mark Ruffalo, every actor has gotten a chance to explore their characters in a previous movie, which adds to the ""easy-breezy feel"" of the movie. That being said, I thought Mark Ruffalo was a wonderful Bruce Banner -- I'd love to see him in his own movie. The action is non-stop and the CGI is phenomenal. However, this is another case of unnecessary 3D. It's didn't add anything to the effects, except muddle them up on occasion when there was a lot going on. This movie could be shown normally and it would almost be better. Believe the hype. This is an awesome movie. Joss Whedon did an fantastic job with the movie. I can't wait for The Avengers 2."

The story was good. plot was good as well. I can only give this movie a 10. I would give it an eleven but you know I have to stay withing the rules. Is this the best movie every made?

A MUST SEE!,"Like many people, who have been fast forwarding the credits to see the teasing snippet at the end in the Iron Man films, Thor, Captain America etc, I was ridiculously excited to see this film. I'll hold my hands up now and admit that I am a huge sci-fi nerd and regard Thor and Iron Man 1 as two of my favourite ever films (along with titles such as the recent Star Trek, or the Lord of the Rings trilogy). Needless to say, I was not disappointed. This film was, there's only one way to put this... INCREDIBLE! The special effects were out of the world, literally the best effects I have ever seen, on a larger scale than the most recent Transformers film, but less in your face and over powering. The effects were first rate, completely seamless and is definitely something to watch on the big screen, rather than wait for the DVD.I found that the acting was really good as well, everyone pulling their weight with a big nod towards Tom Hiddleston who i believe was one of the stars of the show. Definitely the best Hulk there has ever been and Chris Hemsworth was utterly fantastic. Needless to say, Robert Downey Jr will deserve all the plaudits he takes from this film as he was brilliant, as always, in his role of Tony Stark. Even Scarlett Johansson, who many assumed would just be ""token bo__"" was really good and her character had surprising depth.This is one of those films where you cant help but smile while watching it as you follow an incredible story line while witnessing faultless special affects. I cannot recommend this film enough, I have seen it once at the cinema and have already booked tickets to go see it again. The phrase ""a must see"" has not been as relevant since Lord of the Rings, People..GO SEE THIS FILM!"

Although this movie was just about 2 1/2 hours long, it was so entertaining and engrossing for me that it seemed like about 1 1/2 hours. The character development was good and each character was given a bit of screen time to develop the character. The action was good and not overpowering, it only added to rather than being the main part of the movie. The comic level was perfect. Not too much goofy stuff said just to try and get laughs. Every line, imo, was perfectly placed (although I'll have to see it again in order to hear some funny lines that I missed due to the laughter in the theater!). By the way, morning matinée was SOLD OUT full. Each character was ""in character"" as we know them...Captain America was still the 40's guy; Iron Man was still, well, Iron Man, Thor...perfect, the Hulk - super good, best depiction I've seen, etc. I thoroughly enjoyed this movie because it fulfilled all my ""likes"" for a movie...good vs. evil and good kicking butt; enjoyable fun time and escape, good dialog, good looking and PG.

What made Spiderman stand apart was that it was a great movie and a great Superhero movie. Well, move over because Avengers did most everything right enough to at least have a discussion of whether Spiderman 1 or Avengers 1 was the better movie. It might have helped that I do not know the Avenger lore as well as I knew others, but everyone else is in agreement. I am reluctant about this statement, because you hear something is the best ever and then it never lives up. I read a lot of hype in these pages before I went and saw it. Now I have seen it and must agree with the hype.One thing I was afraid of: Mark Ruffalo as The Hulk, which I am a little still out on, but I do like Mark Ruffalo, but made Bruce Banner a little too weak/effeminate. It comes together nicely though. Another was ScarJo. Yes, she is sexy enough(understatement) but was she athletic enough to carry it out and she did well enough. Another problem, the bravado/""egos"" of the characters, not stars, but characters of such a movie would demand a lot of screen time for each one to make this work. That would be a problem if it was not accomplished. The movie was very good on this point. Cobie, Robin from How I met Your Mother, was a bit of a distraction for me in a secondary role, but did a competent job. The most interesting thing for me was that Joss Whendon was Director and Writer. He created Buffy/ Angel, Firefly/Dollhouse. I wondered how he would do with such mainstream fair and he managed to bring everything together almost perfectly. I say almost because there is one bit that is missing. It is somewhat minor, but who taught Bruce Banner the secret to control his angry green side. That is the only piece missing for me.For those that want specifics: effects were top notch, acting was excellent, story lines were compelling, the comedy was perfect 99.5% of the time and surprise there were a lot of one line typical superhero zingers that worked really well.I think you will enjoy this movie, unless you only enjoy completely realistic movies."

(Spider Man 3 was a classic example of this goof up) 2. Was concerned about the Mega Villain. 3.Bad reactions on the casting of Mark Ruffalo as HULK. 4. Lately, a lot of Super hero movies were flops or average. (Green Lantern & Iron Man)But now, I would definitely ask you all to watch this movie.. coz . 1. The movie has cleverly given the screen time to everybody. 2.Loki made a tough Villain to beat alone. 3. Everybody loved Mark and as well as the HULK. 4. Timing of the funny moments were spot on. 5.Technologically good as par with Avatar and Transformer 3. 6. The best Super Hero Movie out now with Batman series. 7.

There's a reason this is only the second super hero movie in the top 250. Coz its worth it. Period.I was absolutely glued right from the first minute. It was an awesome mixture of high-end action, drama, suspense, thrill, humor and love! OK maybe not love. Who would want that in a super hero movie anyway?Iron Man was at his brutal best whether it was tactics, word play, narcissism or just plain old explosive action. He just did not disappoint! If you thought Iron Man only did solo, you are in for a surprise.I thought Hawkeye and the Black Widow were going to be just another pair of dummies. NOT! They are as much a part of the story as the rest of them. Be prepared for some of their cool moves. Man, does Scarlett look stunning when she is beating the hell out of the bad guys. Hawkeye might have done way better with a gun, but what the hell. To each his own! Thor and Cap. America, the demigod and the strategist, with the awessssome weapon and shield combo, totally kicked butt(ask Loki's horde)! Perhaps, there was little the captain could do with just his shield.And the best for the last. For those who had lost all hopes of Hulk ever entertaining them, this one changes it all. He is now my favorite today! What raw madness (ask Loki)!! This time Hulk gives it all with a pinch of humor that we have missed in the previous two movies.The first half was built around bringing all the super-heroes together and setting up the story line without deviating from the end plot. The second half just blows you away. Joss Whedon seems to have become a master artist when it comes to super cool dudes. He's given each of the good guys an equal say in the movie with none in particular ruling the show.In the end the 2 and a half hours of non-stop fun seemed to be way less and I was left craving for more :( .

Anyways, I just got a chance to see the most awaited film of 2012 and honestly, I wasn't disappointed. The movie was actually the most epic movie I have seen so far. Yes, I might change this decision after I see The Dark Knight Rises or MIB 3 but this movie has certainly impressed me. The movie has major plus points and one of them is the dialogs. The mix of action and humorous dialogs entertain and provide good moments to appease the audiences. I am sure, several people loved the dialogs but I just admired them. The action scenes, were not overdone and were certainly better than G.I Joe series which was not really anything impressive for me. But, there is a lot more to this film that gave me that feeling that this is the epic movie and It wasn't a waste to wait for so long. The action scenes are good, though there was a lot of explosions, they impress. The best part is the acting, our superheroes and even our villain say funny dialogs and perform good action. Plus, the story is effective for a 2 hour movie as many movies longer than 1 hour 30 mins are usually lagging in parts and fail to present a good story. But, this movie doesn't drag and doesn't make you fall asleep. Acting is top notch, Robert Downy Jr. is the best, Thor is good, Captain America, the rest are awesome. In general, this movie was damn good. I wasn't bored, and I enjoyed every freaking moment."

Will Robert Downey Jr. ever get back to the brilliance of Iron Man 1 or have cocky dialogs won over a cool plot? b.) Mark Ruffalo as the hulk? Why not Edward Norton? c.) Hawkeye – not a superhero but just a guy with good aim. Black Widow – no powers again.is she just for eye-candy? d.) Will Hemsworth get more screen time and a better plot than what Thor offered him? e.) Loki the main villain – is this going to be yet another Thor vs Loki battle with the others just chipping in? f.) Will too many superheroes dilute the plot & will they be eating up each other's screen time? g.) Is technology going to win against a good storyline once again? (Ref: All the other Transformer films except the 1st!) h.) So many of them..will Iron Man hold fort in the ""team""?Honestly I didn't even care for Evans and Captain America as much as I did for Thor & Iron Man. And I must say with the runtime being 145 minutes, I wondered if it would be a drag.THE VERDICTThe movie takes time to settle into the plot & setting up the characters, unlike Thor were I felt the movie just rushed through and could have been so much more.The film IS LARGER THAN LIFE. Unlike Iron Man 2 or Captain America which left me wishing they had done more.Loki does a great job of portraying the villain. Thor delivers, Black Widow & Hawkeye are manageable. But nothing can compare to the fact that Ruffalo actually fits this version of Hulk way better than Norton could have done. And of course, Iron Man rocks. Rocks like he never did.By the time you reach the second half, the story has built in enough punch to make you wish there was an epic battle to follow and not a lame effort. And it does deliver. Great action, lot of mayhem, every superhero getting his screen time.Hulk & Iron Man indeed steal the show. Good dialogs & well timed comic quips here and therea perfect start to the 2012-13 tent-pole league. Now if only The Hobbit & Dark Knight Rises keep up to this level, its gonna be a great year! :)"

For starters, I thought ""Iron Man"" (Robert Downey Jr.) and ""the Hulk"" (Mark Ruffalo) were absolutely sensational. Likewise, most of the other characters were well played too. On the flip-side though the introduction of ""Hawkeye"" (Jeremy Renner) was terribly planned and presented. Not only was the character development badly mishandled but the fact that this person got so much screen time when there were others with much better credentials just boggles the mind. Not only that but his costume-or basic lack thereof-also stuck out like a sore thumb. Additionally, although I liked the CGI I thought it and the non-stop action were just too overwhelming. Even more important was the fact that there were too many characters and not enough film to go around between them. This made the film look extremely uneven. Too many cooks do indeed spoil the soup. Be that as it may, this movie should have been very good but in all frankness it turned out to be a jumbled mess. All things considered then I think the really good points were dragged down by the lack of direction which resulted in a very mediocre film. Accordingly, I rate it as only average."

The film gets straight to the point, LOKI steals the Tesseract, Avengers are called together and WHAM......Sit back and enjoy the fight/ride/thrill and Humour. Tony Stark adds excellent spark and quick one liners, just as he does in Ironman 1&2. Thor, Captain America and Hawkeye all play there part in taking down Loki and his army of aliens but for me the HULK is, for the first time in a movie, genuinely scary and fierce as he destroys almost everything in his path. The film really works as it stays well clear of any LOVE interest that slows down so many other superhero films. Black Widow is the female lead and she kicks butt with the best of them. All in all this is a brilliant film that is SUPERHEROS vs SUPER VILLAINS!! If that sounds good to you go see this film & then watch it again tomorrow!!"

It sets the bar so high for comic book movies. DC is (was) seriously in a lot of trouble after The Avengers came out. If you have seen each of our hero's individual films, you will easily enjoy The Avengers ten times more. You will be also ten times more excited to see everything played out. I also feel like I need to say that I was very, very nervous when I heard The Avengers was announced. In film, we like to focus on one character, and we like to see that one person change over the course of the movie. It's hard to keep track of multiple characters, which is why the single-hero format works so well. Otherwise we end up with meathead city, like The Expendables. Gross. Luckily, we have The Avengers instead.So our unlikely heroes team up together to defeat Thor's brother, Loki. Luckily, all of these overpowered world savers are used to having each other as company, PSYCHNOTREALLY. They all have pretty big egos, let's be honest, but we don't see just how big their egos are until they all share one movie together. Jump ahead, they have to learn how to cope with one another, and just barely tolerate each other in order to stop the world-destroying threat.There is some absolutely wonderful cinematography, put together by Seamus McGarvey. Did I mention how clever the script is? Joss Whedon poured his fricking essence into the pages of writing, and it pays off so very nicely. I don't feel like The Avengers was missing anything that ticked me off. I also have never been so excited for a sequel before in my life. My only hope is that Disney can buy out Spiderman from Fox, and we can get some Spiderman action in there But I digress.The Avengers flat out rocked my socks off. 9/10."

By 1/3 the way into the film, none of the characters draw one in, the story is uncompelling and I find myself only waiting in boredom for the next fight scenes which turn out to be formulaic and insufficient to warrant further viewing. The designs for various scenes and characters also fail. They look plastic and cheap and distracting from the story rather than immersive. Save your time and money and skip this title. Evidently these reviews have a minimum line count which is equivalent to paying by the word. So let me be verbose. This film was not even fun to watch the villains tearing apart the world because they look so silly in their costumes, their character building moments are horribly predictable and shallow, and what is up with the designs for Loki? He looks more samurai than Scandinavian god, which I am sure is a tip of the hat to the samurai influence in comic books, but let's get real for a moment. He's a bloody Norse god. He should look Norse. If he's going to look so radically different from Norse mythology -- all cybernetic-anime -- then there needs to be some kind of story and character building to explain it."

I really hope this new gem of a movie is not used to try and imitate the formula without the magic this one has because, make no mistake, behind all this special effects, shiny images, action scenes and interactions what stand about the most on this movie is the chemistry between all the heroes, even the villain, there is no denying.From a guy who hate superheroes movies I give this movie a perfect 10, this is no joke this movie is THE BEST blockbuster of this year, totally recommended, even for the wife who hates explosions and the kids will love it!PD: please watch the whole ending, even after the credits, that last 2 minutes are PRICELES!"

I find them entertaining but they are often similar and rarely deliver quite such the memorable and action-packed experience that 'Avengers Assemble' offers. Seriously, whether you are a Marvel fan or not, give this film a chance, it may very well surprise you.I can't think of any particularly large faults to this movie that are worth mentioning, the plot isn't exactly unique but that's not what I saw as the purpose of the film. The film's plot tied together the previous Marvel films featuring heroes such as Iron Man and Captain America very well, it then went on to set up and deliver a roller coaster ride of sci-fi action unlike anything I've ever seen before in a Marvel film.'Avengers Assemble' certainly beats the previous films in terms of CGI, action, characters and memorability. From the opinions of friends, I know that the film has even appealed to those that aren't directly a fan of sci-fi action. There is certainly something about the film that simply stuns the viewer and impresses them with up-to-date visuals and a fast-paced storyline. A fact worth mentioning is that, unlike previous films, 'Avengers Assemble' doesn't take itself too seriously. It's not a comedy, or a parody, but it does allow for humorous moments that actually made me smile more than some actual comedies have. This allows you to enjoy the film further I feel, rather than taking away the more serious elements.If you haven't seen the film already, make sure to find the time to watch it, it will entertain you in some way or another and is definitely worth at least one viewing. Truly one of the better movies of the past decade."

But when seeing it the second time you start to pick up on somethings and it just isn't that good. Now I am not downing this movie since it's not as entertaining as the first time seeing it. But you just notice some weaknesses. Now when it comes to the plot there really isn't anything all that original. A certain team needs to get their act together and not quarrel, bicker and fight amongst each other. In order to fight and win against a battle or a game when the odds are against them. Seem familiar? Because it has been done countless times. But the execution is the most important thing and the execution for the movie is well done and entertaining most of the way through. The final fight at the end is worth the price of admission. However when it comes to the plot there really isn't anything special that makes it stand out. The plot and editing in ""John Carter"" in my opinion is more well done than this in my opinion. But unfortunately ""John Carter"" didn't do so well at all when compared to this movie. Now Josh Whedon did a pretty good job when it comes to the Marvel characters portrayed in this movie and stuck pretty close to the comic book materials. But in the comics although the characters are arrogant there are other elements that turns it away from it being the main focus. For this movie arrogance is the main part of what the characters face and is one of the biggest obstacle in their path. What ""The Avengers"" do is constantly have a penis measuring competition with each other when the world is at stake. Anyways the fighting and action sequences are really entertaining and cool to watch. Some scenes are like superhero smackdown battles so those scenes were entertaining as well, despite it all happening over arrogance and pride. So that is why I give this movie a 7.8/10.7.8/10"

People want to sit down with their friends/family/etc., watch a movie, and walk out feeling energized after a stressful day at work or school. Not that thought-provoking movies are ""too much"" for audiences, but sometimes ""reality"" isn't what people want to pay to see.

If you come to a movie wanting nothing but two hours of fighting and explosions, this film will exceed your expectations, but if you watch films for insights on human nature, to see well developed, interesting characters, and to see a carefully devised ingenious plot, this film may not be for you.

I was expecting a ""Michael Bay style"" movie with nothing but CGI, but there is so much more to flashing lights in this movie (unlike Transformers 2,3).The character clash worked really well as some scenes included just the heroes communicating and interacting. The characters were all brilliant with a superb cast e.g Downey Jr. But the Actor that stood out the most was none the less than Mark Ruffalo (where has he been all this time?. This guy fits so well into the clothes of Bruce Banner, as he really portrays the human and the scientific side of the hulk, he also shows the battle with him self that he is constantly fighting. The Hulk in this movie was expected,lets be honest, to be a 'side character' instead he was a BEAST, no, better THE HULK. I also liked how Lou Ferigno makes his cameo as the voice of the Hulk. As for the rest of characters such as Iron Man,Captain America and Thor they all shared really equally big roles. Black Widow's character is not only the 'pretty face' but, an extremely shrewd woman. Perfect woman? Or is it just me? Hawkeye the last character, like we all expected draws the short straw, but not as short as you would expect, as he is seen doing some amazing stuff. The Antagonist Loky has a great impact in the movie, as the contrast of characters between Him and Thor, Tony Stark and the rest escalates the tension to breaking point.The film adopts a light hearted feel at times, which smooths the film with some light humour. The visuals were incredible, especially with the Hulk transformation (finnally we get to see that) and the battles.I would suggest watching Iron Man, Iron Man 2, Thor, the Incredible Hulk and the first Avenger (find out the order on IMDb) before you watch the avengers. Remember if you have not gone Cinema to watch it yet, stay till the very END.{Unfortunately for me i think i know how avengers 2 is going to end to find out my imaginary ending search up Spider man 1994 episode 57...

335,422,0.04478316,0.38830924,0.56690764,7,Surprisingly very good!,"It was a surprise that I actually liked Marvel's The Avengers. My expectations were a film about a bunch of superheroes exercising their powers for the sheer amusement of the comic-book fans. Indeed, I was right about the exercise of power (naturally enough) but the way such showing-off was employed is what I like about the film. While, on the surface the events may seem to revolve about a group of mentally immature superheroes, there are several references to a deeper meaning, presented in a hilarious, light way with focus on both action and dialogue alike.The undertone found in The Avengers has to do with the current universal trend of freedom and rebels. Loki makes it clear that his purpose is to fix the 'problem' which earth inhabitants have of misunderstanding the meaning of 'freedom' claiming they 'are made to be ruled'. Also, there is an indirect mention of fallen regimes, in general, and particularly the fall of the Soviet Union. Though this subject is not dealt with depth, it gives some weight to the light nature of the film. A film about superheroes is not expected to tackle serious issues but, at the same time, films whose main aim is to entertain the viewer should still not be an embodiment of triviality as is the case in many comedies of the last few years.This is delivered through a balance between action and dialogue. The film is action-packed like a superhero film should be, though this does not come at the expense of dialogue; action sequences are supported by the amazing CGI (with a special nod to the resemblance between Dr Banner and the Hulk). Dialogue, similarly, plays an important role in the development of events and the relationship between the characters.Wittily, this is coated with a fair amount of good humour. Though some jokes could be predictable, the spontaneity of the performances makes them, unarguably, funny. For example, towards the end, when Rogers is giving orders to policemen, what follows is pretty predictable but the spontaneity of the policeman made viewers laugh despite themselves. Non-verbal humour even mounts to a point when viewers clapped hard – when Dr Banner's 'other guy'shut Loki up with a slight movement of his huge arms.Such elements gather, in the end, to make a film that, successfully, transcends the circle of comic-book fans, delivering one of the best films of the season."
336,424,0.01952241,0.13782917,0.8426482,7,Fantastic superhero movie - best from Marvel in years!,"Initially when I first saw the trailer I was a bit reluctant about this flick – I thought it would be another good, but average superhero movie. After watching it, however, I just had to admit: this was one of the best action movies I've seen in years.The story is a simple as that: Locki returns with his obsession of being a 'beloved' king and along with his army decides to dominate Earth. Then, Nick Fury makes a union with Iron Man, Hulk, Thor and Captain America (The Avengers) to save our planet.Reading this synopsis may make you think this is a silly movie, but it is because of this simplicity that 'The Avengers' is so good. The story just gets direct to the point without hesitation and involves the audience since the beginning. There is also some laughing moment between the action scenes – which I felt was great. Just to break the ice – Iron Man with his sardonic jokes.Another aspect I felt while watching it was how it was made to be unpretentious, but fun and entertaining. I have noticed that some recent Hollywood movies have been failing on these points – I mean, sometimes they try to make action films so 'complex' and serious – but why complicate it? We are just looking forward a nice film to relax and enjoy the time and 'The Avengers' provides it easily – at least for me it did.Then, mix all these aspects with a lot of explosions – yes, they destroyed Manhattan again! – astounding visual effects and a great cast (this time we have the best Hulk ever with Mark Ruffalo). The result: fantastic superhero movie."

A little too much time is spent with the 'peripheral' characters; black widow, Hawkman and Fury but from the moment that one of the key protagonists first goes toe to toe with Loki, the film picks up pace. What follows is entertaining but I think keener fans of the marvel universe will feel the middle of the film comes just short of delivering expectations. For example a fight match-up that was mean't for the big-screen including two of the most powerful of the entourage left me asking for more. All is forgiven though as the action gets better and better throughout and by then end when you think you've seen the finale it just keeps going. The last 30 minutes of the film is the best of any superhero flick to date though I do wonder if the budget for CGI could have been spread across the earlier parts of the film less thinly. The humor throughout is hilarious though at moments it risks taking the material not seriously enough as though the cameras stopped rolling and everyone can stop pretending to be superheroes. One of the heroes is the butt of the joke more often than fair and doesn't get so many memorable lines or opportunities to show off like the others so if you happened to pick this one as a favorite you might be a little disappointed if not for the fact that the others in the entourage do kick so much ass."

All the actors did a great job portraying their role, and the visual effects are amazing, my favorite character in this movie is ""Hulk"", I mean I hate him in the other movies, but in this film, whoa he's great, he's strong and heavy (Funny when he smash ""Thor""), and Black Widow, whoa... she's not only hot but she's also dangerous, well overall it was an amazing experience. I wanna see it again, I'll rate it a 8.5 over 10! ASSEMBLE!"

I expected an action movie with awesome graphics and fight scenes, and that's what you get, world class entertainment. I enjoyed the character development and subtle hints that give a bigger meaning. Also this movie has a chunk of comedy, not the annoying kind but the kind that blends into the movie perfectly to give you a laugh but not take away the seriousness of the film (too much). It was cliché but what can you expect. The actor's are flawless and keep up with who they are meant to be. The only part I really didn't like, but also didn't expect was the lack of feeling. A lot of the good movies I watch I come out feeling different, like the movie has effected me, but I felt nothing, (except for one part but it wasn't enough to give a real feeling to the movie). All in all, this is an action packed movie, sure to give you entertainment, not boring at all, funny, has some smart moments and a must see movie for anyone."

No Spoilers!,"I am not going to go into any spoilers or tell people to go see this movie, I am sure if you are reading these review you are already going to go see the movie. I also will not go into all the awesome things that went down at this early screening in Century City like; an unexpected visit by some major people who were lightly involved with the movie..........nobody that contributed that much..just Joss Whedon, Kevin Feige, Chris Hemsworth, and Loki himself, Tom Hiddleston but who cares about that, oh wait.....everybody there!!!OK so now for the review....I believe this movie is everything it is hyped up to be, I am not going to go into all the things I could praise about this movie because there are so many things and it would take awhile. HOWEVER, I will state the two things that I have a minor ""PROBLEM"" with and should be the only ""COMPLAINTS"" about this movie. 1. Joss Whedon said that he CUT the original movie down from 3 HOURS down to 2 hours and 15 minutes, this is something you will definitely notice if you pay enough attention. This leaves room for some ""out of place"" scenes and some fully unexplained situations, but I am guessing it was the studio's decision to do this so don't blame Joss because he did a great job with this enormous task. 2. The reason why this film might gain LESS critical ACCLAMATION then dark knight rises, or ANY OTHER comic book movie, is because of the huge load of Characters that this movie has to balance. I am not saying they are not handled perfectly, BUT it is still much different then a movie with ONE central HERO. All of these main heroes have had their OWN movies, you will need to remember this in order to properly weigh how Joss Whedon handled all of them together. Overall, I think almost anybody will thoroughly enjoy this movie, whether you just like action movies or whether you sit around waiting for new Avengers news to come out. I am a big Marvel fan and I was very speculative about this movie on whether it would be a worthy representation of the Avengers and it completely delivers. Support this movie so that we can have more and more like it."

The movie has a very good balance of heroism and humour, great characters' development, an interesting villain, great action-packed sequences and a big use of the CGI.

The fight scenes were well choreographed, and the CGI was well done. The script cast some stellar characters with interesting backgrounds.In theory this movie should have been tailored to my liking.Unfortunately...I spent the first half of the movie dead bored and wondering how much was left. What this film lacked was character. We didn't see any depth of character. It doesn't matter that the actors or actress showed great facial expressions (reactions), their character was never explored beyond that. They remained flat, personable characters.And yes, I did read the arguments all over the internet: ""That's what the other movies were for. They showed character. Go watch those."" This leads me back to my first statement. It doesn't matter if it's already been done in a preceding movie. I expect to be wowed in THIS movie.To me, this movie came off as melodramatic.I was the wrong audience for this film.Recommends it for: Marvel fans; action-superhero genre fans."

347,436,0.19515727,0.35853127,0.4463115,8,"Wanted to hate it, ended up loving it","I'm not really a comic book fan, so after hearing the constant hype about this film for a couple of years I really wasn't too fussed when it finally appeared on TV. I went into it expecting not to like it much, and indeed the first hour seemed to me middling at best: some mildly lame comedy, a whole lot of posturing, and a silly storyline involving silly characters.Then things changed. They started to pick up, and the action started hitting home. Then all hell broke loose with a climax that felt like it lasted a whole hour, an hour packed with kaiju-style mayhem as New York found itself subjected to an alien invasion. And I was wowed. Never before has it been possible to depict such constant, wide-scale mayhem, but with the improvement of CGI technology it's finally up there on screen with all of its glory.And yes, I ended up liking MARVEL'S AVENGERS ASSEMBLE. What's not to like, really? The whole feel is kept light and there are so many larger-than-life characters that you end up having a ball with it regardless. Mark Ruffalo's Hulk is my favourite character by far - Ruffalo is far better suited to the role than Eric Bana or Edward Norton - but Chris Evans's Captain America comes a close second. Sure, I see this film for what it is: a mindless piece of crowd-pleasing, overblown CGI mayhem, replete with a silly, buffoonish bad guy - but at the same time I can't help but getting caught up for the ride."
348,437,0.7530051,0.2064571,0.04053781,4,How to scam millions from the public.,"Groan. I find this movie dull, tedious and boring. It just doesn't work on any level Let's start with the Hero's. For a start there's too many. Their characters only get enough screen time to be show in one shade. All exempt iron man who is show to be like a god or something, and that is daft.The story itself makes no sense and gives the feeling that they were making it up as they went. The visuals are OK but nothing to shout about. The comedy kinda works but after you seen it once it tends to drag. It feels like they were trying to be funny instead of it being naturally funny.The avengers is the perfect example of directors thinking about money by pandering to those who have an IQ in single figures and an explosion fetish, instead of thinking about the art of creating a good movie. I would have given this film a one star but it does have one saving grace or rather three. The strong acting from hulk, Loki and captain America drag this movie though by the scruff of its neck. Overall Poor film"
349,438,0.1554762,0.44348085,0.401043,6,Big Loud Messy Entertainment,"The Avengers was very well waited among Marvel comic book fans and general superhero fans. When it comes to delving deeply into the minds or motivations of the film's other, previously established heroes, he abstains all together. And maybe that's for the best. Even with 2 hours and 24 minutes to kill, there's precious little time for him to offer remedial courses in Marvel mythology. Those who haven't done their homework and watched the previous films still should be able to follow the basics, but they almost certainly will be left scratching their heads from time to time. In the mix among stars doing battle are Scarlett Johansson, who plays the Black Widow, and Jeremy Renner as archery expert Hawkeye. There were a lot of high expectations for this film and on many levels it delivers, while on few others it disappoints. Since writer-director Joss Whedon was dealing with so many big-name stars, like Robert Downey Jr., who reprises his role as Iron Man, Gwenyth Paltrow as Pepper Potts and Mark Ruffalo, who takes over the role of Dr. Bruce Banner a.k.a. the Hulk, there's just not enough screen time to fit everyone adequately in.For those who have kept up with it, though, The Avengers is a nice payoff to a sprawling and ambitious filmmaking strategy, and one whose blueprint can be counted on to change the way major studios approach their superhero franchises for years to come.
==========
As a rewatch 05/01/18' and nearly 5 years since initial watch 12/10/13' opinions remain near same. The Avengers has great entertainment value, though at the same time some of it feels quite bland and uninteresting. The finale battle elevates the film as a whole but much forgettable scenes I had forgotten."

Is Loki, the villain that WEAK? Maybe he couldn't adapt to the Earth's environment? And his army? Look like they're adopted from Transformers! What's good about this film? It's 3D, nothing more.It took me almost a week to watch this because it's too boring. Our superheroes, their jokes, their love line, their problem... no interesting, easily solved. End!Old superheroes' formula, boring story. If you want to kill time, go on."
351,440,0.37553743,0.32934368,0.29511878,5,I saw the movie with high hopes.,"It is very much save to say that only truly super hero addicts will love this. I don't read the comics anymore because Id rather read a book or watch a movie could be my age as well. This is overrated beyond all ends. The villain is annoying beyond all ends. Because you have to incorporate so many characters you have to cram all this crap into one movie and personally the individual films are much better. This felt like an overdose of flashy sh*t everywhere and the story is rather dull. I went in this movie with high hopes because I on occasion enjoy super hero movies. My favorites have to be the Tim Burton & Christopher Nolan Batman films. Those were fantastic. This is a mess. With over two hours of flashy ridiculous plot twists and cgi up the a** only Super Hero, Comic Book, Addicts and little kids will really appreciate this. If you have a brain and want more realism in a film avoid this crap aside. I gave it a 5 because some of the special effects were impressive and some of the action was cool and lets be real Scarlett Johanson is hot as hell. But this movie barely qualifies as a 5. You want a true action film with a super hero taste go with The Dark Knight or Batman Begins."
352,441,0.12572159,0.40352595,0.47075242,5,The avengers assemble,"If you like your typical action packed superhero movie, The Avengers is the perfect movie. It has action, suspense, and humor with a touch of romance thrown in. It has amazing heroes, a great villain, fighting scenes, a rivalry between hero and villain, and an all-star cast. What it lacks, is originality. All superhero movies are the same, the world has been threatened in some way and a superhero must rise to the occasion to overcome the threat. The ongoing battle between good and evil, which isn't any different in this movie. What makes The Avengers different from other superhero movies is the compilation of characters. The world has been threatened once again and we need Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.), Thor (Chris Hemsworth), Captain America (Chris Evans), the Hulk (Mark Ruffalo), the Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson), and Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner), to come together and save us, as Thor's brother Loki (Tom Hiddleston) plans to use a glowing cube called the Tesseract to open a portal bringing an evil alien army to Earth to help takeover. We have beat Loki before in the movie Thor, now he is back with a vengeance. Unfortunately if you have not seen these movies you will need to catch up as there is not a lot of back story on why these heroes were chosen. With everything going on you do not really get to understand the characters, especially why Loki wants to control the world. Even if you haven't seen them you know what to expect and can understand the basic storyline. There are no surprises, you can plot out the movie before you even watch it. Overall, I found the movie to be exiting, but explored way too many times. The whole idea of needing a superhero to come save us has been done before. Originality is what makes a movie great. Director Joss Whedon did a great job compiling different characters together into one movie. Even with amazing special effects and compelling characters, I believe he could have made a better storyline with more surprises. We should be walking away thinking, ""Wow, I did not expect that to happen!"" The world will continue to want heroes in their lives. In movies like The Avengers, we are given hope that good will always overcome evil. Which is why I'm sure they will be coming out with another one soon. I just hope to be speechless and amazed when it's over."
353,443,0.5245699,0.34211165,0.13331848,8,Bad Points,"OK, now although I thought this movie was good, the two things that kept annoying me every time I had to stare at them were:Captain America: Come on the Rubber baby helmet look was terrible are you telling me that they couldn't find a better look for him. The costume was terrible. 1. I know it's traditional but come on come up with something new; the light blue was terrible and looked like a child's costume. I mean the darker blue in Captain America the 1st avenger was better than in Avengers. 2. The rubber baby helmet. What the hell!! It looked terrible they could have done something that came up to his ears, and wrapped around his head letting his hair come out the top. Sorta of like Cyclops in Xmen, I'm sorry the full head cover was absolutely terrible. Chris Evans is a good looking Actor Show him off more, not make him look ridiculous. I mean if they can revamp Superman costume and make it look fantastic... They need to go back on the drawing board on Captain Americas Costume.The Hulk: Honestly I couldn't stand looking at him the digital creation they had was horrible. They went from The hulk (2003) which was a bit cartoonish, but OK. To The Incredible Hulk (2008) which I think was fantastic, the CGI was fantastic you could see muscle def, hair moved instead of looked glued down, and looked like a HULK. The hulk they had in the avengers look run down, old, ""Smaller"" I always envisioned hulk as a big massive thing. This hulk was barely towering over anyone. I'm sorry I just didn't agree with the thing they had there at all. But because they have recast the hulk like 20 times, also brings down the appeal how can you really build up your appeal for the character if you keep changing out the actor. That is an ""Epic Fail""!!But other than that I liked the movie, was very good, better than the XMen why because they were actually fighting something bigger than the screen. I hate like XMen where everyone they were fighting was the same, and so small... they needed to throw in an Apocalypse, Onslaught, something was the enemy is a real Enemy. So other than those small changes I think the movie was great for its genre"

YES!,"Even with the action packed fighting scenes of numerous superheroes and very clever humor, The Avengers fails to live up to its expectations as being the best superhero movie ever made.Basically, the only people who were acting in the movie were; Captain America, Nick Fury & Black Widow, the rest were there just to fight. Even if that was the soul purpose of the movie, not a lot of work was put into the performance of the main characters, except for the ones mentioned above.Still don't know why Captain America and Hawkeye were casted in the movie, they have no soul importance. Yes, Captain America is inspiring but Marvel could've surely gone with ANYONE else. Maybe wait another year and let the reboot of Spiderman release and cast Spiderman in The Avengers. The only thing that exceed's expectation is the Hulk with its awesome power and dominance (even that was kept very late)There weren't any jaw-dropping action scenes but there were some great laughs when the heroes fought or argued with each other.All in all, it can be called a disappointment, because I really don't think this movie is better than Spiderman or Spiderman 2 or Batman Begins or The Dark Knight or Iron Man or The Incredible Hulk or even Thor. In my opinion, this not the best Marvel movie ever made, the reason to which I think could be that, it was done very hurriedly. Bad - NO....Disappointed - YES!!7/10"

Anyway, some are highly entertaining, such as Spider Man 2 and Batman: The Dark Knight, but nothing that really send chills down my spine, induces into goosebumps or makes my eyes wet.It has some very cool, awesome moments, but it is not like The Matrix awesome: Its mediocre/okay awesome. It is a highly overrated film here in the IMDb, it is surely not top 250 material in any way, shape of form. I was disappointed when I saw the film, because it had a 8.7 score on IMDb at the time. Obviously, the product of nerdgasmic reaction to an accurate depiction of the characters in the comics. Anyway, I don't read superhero comics, so..."

Best film of the year so far. That's all I really have to say about this movie. Basic Details to mention would be that the CGI is pretty good but can still stick out a bit easily. Another thing to mention is that it can be a little long for people under the age of 13. Also I don't care how old your kid is or how much they would want to see this film. Do not take them to it or rent it (when it's released on DVD and Blu-ray) until they're thirteen.

The characters are great abound with great acting from great actors like Robert Downey, Chris Evans, Scarlett Johanson, and Samuel Jackson.

A really good plot, the biggest and most amazing scenes of battle ever, spectacular performances by our heroes and all the cast, awesome visuals effects and another amazing soundtrack.One of the things that really impressed me was the fact the each hero received the right amount of time on the screen and for that was possible to see how much work did everyone do.Of course, once more we have the amazing performance of Robert Downey, Jr as Iron Man that gives us the humor and bravery that we wanted to see by this character. But he is not the only good actor in the movie, we also have Chris Evans as Captain America that delivers the leadership needed, Scarlett Johansson as Natasha Romanoff / Black Widow that show us how amazing a woman can be in a situation of danger, Chris Hemsworth as Thor that gives us that bravery, strenght and performance we wanted to see from him, Tom Hiddleston as Loki that delivers the big villain with no compassion that this movie needed, Clark Gregg as Phil Coulson funny and brave as always, Cobie Smulders as Maria Hill the new woman with a lot of potential, Stellan Skarsgård as Dr. Erik Selvig also great performance, Jeremy Renner as Clint Barton / Hawkeye a actor that show us archery like no one and spectacular performance, our Samuel L. Jackson as Nick Fury funny and amazing as always and another new entrance in the film, Mark Ruffalo as Dr. Bruce Banner / Hulk that delivers the incredible Hulk we all wanted to see.

Robert Downey is a good actor but his trite portrayal of being charming grows tiresome. Marvel movies have alway's lacked depth and true heart. However this movie engages than cruises by fast, a popcorn movie full of great marketing. A movie like this deserves one view, but really easy to forget its poorly written, acted due to all the hype. Its time for Robert to hang the the suit up. The first Iron Man was the only good one, the character is now dull and annoying. Liam as Thor has no on-screen like ability or charisma. Chris Evans plays a somewhat convincing role but he couldn't act his way through Fast And Furious. Mark Ruffalo is the only saving grace of this movie The Hulk will always be a hard hero to get right, he makes it work on all levels. All in all this movie has become pop culture thats all ;a dumb popcorn movie that works until it starts and ends. Another mediocre Marvel movie pretty much this leaves nothing to the imagination."

We are HUGE Marvel fans, and we were excited to see the movie. Our expectations simply were not met relative to all the hype, and this film is not worthy of an 8.6 rating. It's a very good movie, but not great by any means. Here's the good and the bad.The Good: The special effects were outstanding as you would expect. The acting was also nicely done. The script was somewhat well paced, although we both felt it started fairly slowly. The movie did had some of the funniest moments of any super hero film I've seen. The storyline was OK, but that brings me to the bad.The Bad: The storyline was just OK. I won't spoil the movie, but suffice it to say the anti-heroes motivations were somewhat silly to me. That said, it follows (somewhat) to the comic storyline, so the plot was never really all that interesting to begin with. The actors and directors did the best they could with the plot, but I was never pulled into the story that deeply, nor did it strike any emotional connection or interest for me. It was just a great action movie that was well acted with a reasonable script.Avengers is a very good action film, and worthy of seeing on the big screen. However, to see this film rated so close to the Dark Night is preposterous. Those films are in totally different leagues."
361,451,0.11184027,0.36942902,0.5187307,8,Really liked it.,"The Avengers is almost the definition of good time at the movies. Not burdened with the need to spend great amounts of time on character origins, this superhero film takes a conveniently short amount of time to put the game in play, and once it does that, the game is played with flair and showmanship.Quite frankly, the plot itself is absurd, but I guess that was bound to happen when you combine the worlds of five different Marvel heroes. In less capable hands, the Avengers may well have ended up getting muddled from trying to do too much. With Joss Whedon in the director's chair, it's actually a very strait forward two hours with a good level of focus.While New York ends up getting the same treatment as much of Michael Bay's resume, the experience is far less superficial. the Avengers does not insult our intelligence. quite the opposite in fact, it embraces it. The Avengers' best quality is that it never ceases to wink at itself. This is a movie where even the villains the same quick fire one liners as the heroes. A good protagonist of course is also the difference between good action movie and good movie. Simply put, these people (or rather super people) are just good fun to be around. While none of them are ever quite fully rounded, when they come together as a team, they seem far less superficial than they did in their individual movies. with the exception of Iron Man, the films of Thor, Captain America, and The Incredible Hulk, were not all that memorable when it came to characters. The Avengers makes you realize how distinctive each character is.One thing I was a little disappointed in was Samuel L. Jackson. While he is very much at home in the role he plays, it seems pretty obvious that he's just playing himself. Perhaps, there is a hidden positive in this. As a supporting character, you don't wanna upstage the people who have top billings. Personally, I think he could've given The Avengers a little bit more love.Last summer was a somewhat underwhelming year for superheros. It's a pleasure then to see a film like The Avengers fly in to save the day. It's a film made with love, and the work has paid off."

Finally went to see it shortly after it was released in cinemas and was not disappointed one bit. It contained plenty of action and the humour certainly made it better.The Hulk smashed everything in site Thor went berserk with his hammer Captain America's shield is cool Iron Man - well - he took on all of those drones in the final battle, he managed to get a suit on in mid-air and he has the hottest girlfriend. So wish i was him. He was amazing. I think Robert Downey Jr suits the part of Tony Stark really well...its like the character was made for him and am definitely looking forward to Iron Man 3 next year along with an Avengers 2 if one is being made.I recommend this film to everyone who loves superheros and who loves action."

I thought it was better than The Dark Knight and as soon as it started, I felt like seeing Harry Potter all over again at the cinema. It mainly follows up from 'Captain America: The First Avenger', 'Thor' and 'Iron Man 2', S.H.I.E.L.D boss Nick Fury brings together a group of human superheroes who have different identities and events in their pasts: Iron Man (Robert Downey, Jr), Hulk (Edward Norton is out. Mark Ruffalo is in), Captain America (Chris Evans), Thor (Chris Hemsworth) with S.H.I.E.L.D assassins: Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson), Hawkeye (Bourne Legacy's Jeremy Renner) to stop a villain from destroying earth forever. The massive battle scene is incredible. Strangely enough besides that there's a bit more laughter in this than any other SH film. I don't know how the sequel's going to turn out to be. After you've seen this you'll be asking the same question as me: how will it make it bigger and better?

The movie frankly did have a slow start but from the point where we see Tony Stark and Thor in ""Shakespeare in the park"" scene the movie hits of with a non stop action mixed with a very above average hilariousness. Every super hero even Capt.Nick gets a personal intro in the movie each of them better than the other . By the way should mention the Hulk of this movie separately, even though this was his first notable appearance as a super hero or in an action role and that too with other guys who are extremely or slightly experienced in action movies , Mark Ruffalo did stand out from most of the them. Scarlett Johansson and Robert Downey Jr. were fabulous and incredibly entertaining as usual .Chris Hemsworth proves he is better along with his buddies than alone like in his own Thor movie. Tom Hiddleston steels every scene he is in and makes his mark as a great actor. Jeremy Renner , as of for him i really feel like they did make him wait in line to the last with the least important role if there is any in the six of The Avengers. You can really pull that out from the movie. But his Hawk-eye is a brilliant display equally to others.Overall the movie is a great success in my eyes and its worth the while to wait for a sequel. Apart from all hulk is funny in this movie something you don't see everyday. A scene particularly I don't want to say which includes Tom Hiddleston and Mark Ruffalo on the start tower alone deserves all the credits the movie does."

Now I can't wait to see the sequel to the AVENGERS,"Joss Whedon was a great choice for a director, and he always does a good job at finding the right guy to play the villain, Loki. Great collaboration from the actors with fairly equal spotlight given to the characters. By far the best Hulk ever! I've never been a fan of the Hulk until I saw this movie. The only thing I thought was a tad bit cheesy were the space aliens at the end. Some movies have computer generated characters without it looking computer generated, but these definitely looked like they belonged in an xbox360 video game. I'm looking forward to seeing the sequel to this movie. I liked the other characters who were included in this movie as well, even though marvel didn't make any previous movies to introduce them. I have big hopes for the new upcoming Spiderman movies as well, it looks like it will top all its predecessors! Good job Stan Lee and Marvel Studios you give something worthy for DC to compete with."

It's just one of those action-packed, no-intellect-required movies. For this to be #34 in the top movies of all time is shameful. I'm sure many people can think of 250 movies that're far superior to this one.The acting itself was fine, although it did seem a little awkward at times. The dialogue did get extremely cheesy, although it was good cheesy.

Yay, I have now seen Captain America, Iron Man, Thor, and the Hulk battle Loki and his minions from Asgard as the latter try to invade New York City. Co-written and directed by legendary TV icon Joss Whedon (""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"", ""Angel"", and ""Firefly""), he does not disappoint with his love of pop culture and comics as he gives the Marvel characters their justly celebrated status as the distinct characters we've grown to love growing up reading their illustrated adventures in the four-color world they inhabit. And seeing it all in 3-D is such an awesome experience! Oh, and it's great in also seeing Hawkeye, Black Widow, and Nick Fury in tow. Really, all I'll say is you must watch The Avengers. P.S. Seeing Cobie Smulders as one of the characters makes me wonder if she and her ""How I Met Your Mother"" co-star Alyson Hannigan, formerly a ""Buffy"" star, have traded stories of what it's like to work for Mr. Whedon.

But even the best of those movies were just a lead-up to The Avengers, which is absolutely one of the finest superhero movies, and one of the most entertaining movies of any kind, that I've seen.This is pure summer blockbuster fun. And I don't mean that in a way that limits the movie, but instead as an example of the best of what a summer blockbuster can be. The story is rather straightforward: a massive threat to Earth that's too big for any of our heroes to handle alone, and a rocky road of butting egos and misunderstandings stands between them and working together as a team. It's clear, easy to follow, and only has the briefest moments of lost momentum. The Avengers feels like it's the perfect length, with no action scenes that drag on too long into mindlessness or uneven pacing.What struck me most about it was the humor. It carried the movie even more than the excellent action scenes, the well-handled exposition or the interplay between our heroes. The Avengers is outright hilarious at times. The laughs are woven organically throughout. The tone of the movie just feels right, which is probably the best compliment that I can give it.I must say that my expectations were easily surpassed by the first assembly of the Earth's mightiest heroes. Marvel definitely made the right decision to carefully lay the groundwork for The Avengers the past few years, and it paid off. And it helps immensely that they chose the right man to write and direct it. Can't wait for Avengers 2!"

However, dare not expect much in the realm of coherence. One can argue that surrealism and fantasy is at the core of the Marvel Comics experience. However, some people expect a degree of reality to mix with the fiction, which is where ""magic"" happens and classics are made. The enemies that the heroes must face look a lot like video game characters, mindlessly going about their do-harm business for no other reason other than that they are ""bad"". The tactics employed by the enemies are laughable and their strategy non existent. One would expect more of these enemies, especially considering that they are supposed to be so technologically advanced. So in my opinion, it deserves a very high 7, because of the way this is presented, and because it can really entertain for one evening. Just don't expect have much to think or talk about afterwards."

This movie is certainly what all Marvel fans have been waiting for, it's been building up since Iron Man came out in 2008, and despite all the hype it actually did not end up being even a little bit disappointing. Cast members reprising their roles continue to shine, such as Robert Downey Jr. and Samuel L. Jackson, but even the new members deliver great performances, such as Scarlett Johansson and Mark Ruffalo, without a doubt the best Bruce Banner to date, I hope to see him do a solo Hulk movie soon. It looks absolutely beautiful, Joss Whedon was the right choice to direct, it seemed like a messy concept bringing them all together and trying to focus on each character individually, it would have been hard to make it work, but Marvel did it right. An amazing ride from start to finish, the Avengers is the movie superhero fans have been waiting for, and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a good action or adventure. Iron Man, Captain America, Thor, the Hulk and Black Widow are brought together by Nick Fury to form a gang to protect the world from Thor's brother Loki. Best Performance: Robert Downey Jr."

Its definitely a light-hearted movie that doesn't take itself too seriously.It loses some points for basically being too oriented for a kids audience, it was not really my kind of movie because its almost like a Disney theme park ride, and simple minded in a sense.

It gets a well done from me. You have to suspend any logic or common sense to be entertained. If you can, this movie will keep you occupied for over 2 hours. Don't be tempted to make sense out of the story because it leads to questions that invite logic and common sense. The comics can get away with so much because in that world, it comes across as that is what happens in that world. Trying to transfer comics to the screen becomes challenging because trying to bring a super hero to reality is not easy. So we settle for the next best thing which is to make it entertaining. The director pulls that off quite well. In the end, you want to ask your self if you got your monies or tickets worth. The answer is yes. This is not a movie that invites you to come back and see it again. There are no memorable scenes which is its only flaw all things considered. Go see it in the theater and then wait until it comes out on cable. Pass on the DVD purchase. Good popcorn movie, candy, tasty drink and snack...."

Its very funny and is action-packed. The hulk and iron man has to be one of my favorite characters. I usually don't like a lot of movies because they're predictable and boring but you have to take my word on this- The Avengers is one of the best movies I've seen this entire year. You will not regret putting your money into watching this. The graphic was very detailed and it looked very realistic and the story line was fun and it will keep you in your seat for the entire time.

375,468,0.207415,0.47597998,0.31660503,7,"A great summer film. Is it more than that, sorry Joss, no it's not.","The Avengers is not as good as The Dark Knight, I'm just going to say that from the off, the storyline is escapism and it has some genuinely funny moments in it, but it doesn't have the deep characters or visual spectacle. Joss Whedon's script keeps the film going, and lets be honest, this film could have been a train wreck. What makes The Avengers tick is the relationships that each of the characters have with one another. This is where the film really takes flight, when all the characters are in a pressure cooker together, it gives the film weight and suspense especially with Mark Ruffalo's Hulk. Joss Whedon should be given a lot of credit for crafting such a cohesive and well thought out script.The Dialogue is what keeps it above board, visuals have never been Joss Whedon's strong suit, but I did notice a wink to his first feature film Serenity in zoom shots in the action sequences (see Serenity's finale as the ship falls from the sky). The film doesn't look bad by any means it just has the same sheen that the other Marvel films seem to support, but it didn't really have a choice following suit from its predecessors. But lack of visual flair is sometimes what makes me dislike these movies, they look too clean and have a sheen that makes it look too much like a cartoon for my personal taste. Other Superhero film don't seem to have this ""sheen"", making them more visually pleasing to me - the Nolan and Burton Batman's spring to mind as well as the Marvel Xmen films.The film works equally as well in 2D as it does in 3D, the ""third"" dimension is not needed here, the visual storytelling (though nothing groundbreaking) stands on its own two feet, making the 3D gimmick unnecessary. Its very difficult to score this film as it is by and large a fantastic superhero film, thats enjoyable from beginning to end. But enjoyment isn't all I mark it on, was the story original, well no not at all, it was an accumulation of its heroes solo films. Were the visuals good, yes, but they weren't anything you haven't seen in other similar films. The Avengers is fun and Joss's ingenious and humorous dialogue will make you come back for another sitting, but by and large this isn't a anything more than a summer popcorn film, not that it tries to be more either. But what do I know I gave Salt a 9."

The Hulk is scripted better than ever - finally he has been done properly. Banner delivers in every way as normal and he does have a soft spot!

I laugh so hard, i was crying and is not a so called funny movie, like American pie.. The type of the characters are clearly distinguishable, and is the same as in the previous movies. But even if you didn't saw them, you can fully enjoy it, but if you did, it adds something extra.

The cast from The Avengers is the best actors for the characters what so ever, and of course there can be no Iron-Man without Robert Downey Jr. and Chris Evans is just right for the part as our favorite patriot Captain America, if I should mention one more actor who I believe did an outstanding job it would has to be a mix between Tom Hiddleston as Loki and Chris Hemsworth as Thor, those two work so perfectly together and play the characters of the norse/nordic gods better than I could imagine anyone ever will be able to, if you have not seen The Avengers yet you should do your- self a favor and buy it right now! it is that kind of movie that you cannot live without having watched."

Well that a Huge claim. Well TBH it doesn't have any of the qualities of ""Best film ever made"" in it. Story was at best flawed, some characters i would go as far to say as boring and the Special FX were just a cover up, blinding viewers from the truth, its not a great film. And then there's the villain. Weak.But it's not all bad, i thought it was funny and if your a fan of everything exploding then it is good for a quick thrill. Thought Nick Fury, Iron Man and Bruce Banner were good characters.I think the Kindest thing i can say about this movie is that it is Average.

I felt like I watched something out of a kids happy meal and if we are going to expect movies like these in future receiving undeserving acclaim and astounding attention, then I guess it is indeed an offense of naming and giving out Razzberry awards. As I would believe that there are movies with poor reception to be actually highly underrated. The movie starts off with a lousy science experiment at one of the S.H.I.E.L.Ds lab where a portal opens up allowing Loki from an alternate universe to pop in and to begin with his agenda of destruction and dominance. In response to the threat the director of S.H.I.E.L.D Nick fury opens up the Avenger's initiative which has all the super humans or superheroes to team up for you know what. The movie is a cocktail of a lousy plot, poor acting( except for Robert Downey Jr whose presence in the film made it tolerable to some extent). Worst of all it was Samuel l Jackson in his role as the director of S.H.I.E.L.D, Nick fury. I seriously had a problem of tolerating his presence on screen with his unethical portrayal of his character. He only wouldn't be the sole perpetrator, as everyone else(except for Robert again) also portrayed their respective roles like they were starring in some sort of parody of the original. Praise would go to the visual effects and the action sequences which I don't think it is much of a giant leap for mankind in the present date with a good budget of 250 million!, well of course hats off to the animators and sfx designers who did an excellent job to save the sinking boat, at least making it an visual spectacle. The movie is strictly for kids who would certainly enjoy it. So if you are thinking of spending some time out with your kids for the weekend . You won't disappoint them"

Only good thing is surprisingly solid performance of Cobie Smulders and Tom Hiddleston and really good last action fighting scene (even if it's unconvincing and completely transparent), that I luckily didn't sleep over. General observation was be that this kind of blockbusters must have really great and very well elaborated scenery that will naturally lead watcher from individual rampage to team assembly of world greatest heroes (The Avengers: Earth's Mightiest Heroes cartoon series showed how to do that in just 90 min). Hulk is completely lost, Captain America is to plastic, Iron Man is working his daily shift, Thor looks like some intruder on private party and Nick Fury is completely clueless what to do, but still everything turns up fine.

Before I saw it, I decided to watch Iron Man, Iron Man 2, The Incredible Hulk, Captain America and Thor so I'd be all prepared for it. I mean it's everything you'd want from a great movie: excellent action, excellent directing, an excellent cast of actors, excellent dialogue, excellent special effects and an excellent script. I bet it was hard deciding on who would direct this movie with such high expectations but Joss Whedon, who created such TV series like Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Firefly, was the best choice and he directed it perfectly. I mean he didn't overdid like Michael Bay does with action movies. He actually had it well thought-out and the action really works in the movie. It's amazing how you can take a bunch of superheroes from separate movies and come together to make one fantastic movie. Now all the actors did great, but I think Tony Stark/Iron Man is the life of the party because he's the funniest and coolest and Robert Downey Jr. is one of my favourite actors ever. Also Scarlett Johansson, one of my favourite actresses, is tough as she is sexy as Black Widow. And I like the different relationships between the characters. In fact, in my opinion, it's ten times better than The Dark Knight because The Dark Knight was too dark and overdone. But I can't really decide whether The Avengers is better than The Dark Knight Rises because both movies blew my mind away!But after seeing this movie, I've decided that I ought to get reading superhero comics because they're the original source and I love superheroes. But for the next Avengers movie, I'm really hoping that they put Spider-Man and Wolverine in even though most people say it's highly unlikely.

It exhibits the typical American obsession with violence and little or no character development. After fast-forwarding through all the crash bang wallop scenes and still keeping track of the plot, I still didn't care what happened to anyone, including the planet.Scarlet Johansson is completely miscast as the Black Widow. She should be tall and willowy. Mark Ruffalo is perfectly cast as the Hulk as it suits his style of acting, which is usually dumb.I really am a fan of Joss Whedon and own the entire Buffy collection, but I counted two - maybe three - snappy lines of dialogue in this.

A few bated weeks past and I decided it was time to see the film everyone was describing as 'The best film they had ever seen'. Unlikely. I began to watch the film, in an almost empty cinema and found myself bored. I laughed at parts that were not meant to be laughed at and the supposed comedy just left me confused. I made a decision, and walked out of the film half way through. Unsure as to whether the huge hype had just made the film a complete let-down, I decided to give it another chance when it was released on DVD. I realised where the film had gone wrong. As a Marvel fan, I knew the back story, the characters and previous movie plots. However the Avengers failed to explain any of this. No character development what so ever, and although I was aware of the story, I found myself having to wrack my brain to remember things from the comics. The film is just another generic superhero movie. Nothing new, nothing special. I realise this is an unconventional view, but I feel that a lot of people would have enjoyed it because they felt they had to.

Helmed by Joss Whedon, lead up to by several other comic book movies, I really thought this would be amazing.But it's not amazing, it's good. It's about Iron Man good, which puts it a notch above Thor, a notch below Captain America, and several notches above Iron Man II and the Incredible Hulk.There's just not a lot to it. Captain America was a good movie because it delved into the character, but here the movie rarely goes deeper than the occasional witticism. The only character theme is some squabbling, but this comes across as kids on a playground (although it is entertaining to see the movie play the ""what superhero could beat what superhero game""), and resolves itself perfunctorily. This is not what I expect from Joss Whedon; it's what I would have expected from Whedon directly after he made the original Buffy the Vampire Slayer movie.This is not to say that the movie is not enjoyable. It does have some cool special effects here and there and it moves along at a quick pace. The performances are generally good; I particularly liked Mark Ruffalo's laid-back Hulk. It's got some very cute moments sprinkled in, although they feel a little lost among the endless battles.It's a good movie, and if you want a fun popcorn flick this would be a good choice, but it's not a classic."

I am not such a big fan of sequels either. The Avengers was a must-see-film for me, for several reasons, but most of all, I enjoyed both Iron Men, Captain America, and a bit of Thor as well. Hulk did not do the trick to me.The Avengers brings all these superheroes together. Their opponent is Thor's evil half-brother, Loki. His main goal is to get a magical stone, or cube, that would open the gateway to another dimension, to Asgard, where other, even more evil forces await to be released, and freed to the world of the humans.The action in the film, along with the SFX, is great. However, the storyline is not something you have not seen or heard before. Actually, there is very little new to the film. Also the decision to get all the superheroes or stars together, does not really differ much from Expendables, which is somewhat huge phenomenon, even though the script could be written by a 12-year-old.The Avengers is a lot better than Expendables, but that does not mean, it is a whole lot better, and that it would be better than, lets say Iron Man. For me Iron Man alone stands above The Avengers. The film does not come better with bigger explosions, and a lot more heroes, than in the original film. But obviously, with fans of the 80's stars in Expendables, it is enough to bring them all on the screen at once.What I truly enjoyed in this film was actually a few parts of the action. The one with Thor dropping out from the sky, or the parts in the end, with the heroes pretty much destroying most of the city-site.All in all, it is certainly a-must-see for the fans of comic stars, science fiction, and action. I enjoyed, but not that much, that I would recommend it to everybody."

Thor also is also able to travel to earth despite the rainbow bridge being destroyed..there are too many anomalies which leave the viewer perplexed..the only good thing is the acting of Robert Downey Jr..the action is OK..but that is as good as it gets..only watch if you are an ardent fan of super heroes..

Everyone talked about this movie like it's something huge but I'm not so impressed.The actors were great but for an action heroes not enough action.The first hour and a half was just a torture with mindless talk and few fights fought in dark.And the end was similar to the ending of Iron man,the same going in the high altitude,and free falling.I mean you have that massive budget and you couldn't come up with something different.But the ending is only one of the many things that could have been made differently.Just a little more imagination and less effects.Still the 'Star Wars' stand unbeatable."
393,489,0.3987386,0.4459209,0.15534054,6,"Hyped, yet solid.","The Avengers is exactly what I feared it would be, nothing more than a typical superhero action movie. In contrast to Nolan's Batman films, it feels weak and shell-less. Sure, there are radical action scenes and the film is in many ways true to the comics. However, it is not, what its recently and often alleged, a masterpiece. It is just like many previous films, hard-cooked popcorn action (surely inspired by Transformers effects) but not more than that. The lack of manusscript, depth, sound track, pace and sometimes actor-performance is no where near a masterpiece. The SFX, as i mentioned, are very well though. Yet, a movie by comic-book-fans for comic-book-fans. Maybe that is its weakness or its only strength?"

Well, believe the hype! it's great! why? well numerous reasons. One of them is the director they chose for the job of bringing one of the most iconic super teams in comics to life.Joss Whedon has showed time and time again that he knows about both the Marvel Universe (see his run on Astonishing X-men) and Team dynamics(See Firefly or any of his other works)and he works his magic to the max here. another reason is the great cast. while all good, two performances really stand out to me. The first one is Mark Ruffalo as Bruce Banner/Hulk and the second one is Tom Hiddleston as Loki. While I enjoyed Ed Norton's Banner, I felt something was missing from him, Likability. Mark Ruffalo had Likability. Tom Hiddleston's Loki was a great villain that really had that sinister aura about him and he's better here than he was in Thor. Another Reason is the action. Not only does the final scene have An epic battle that rivals Robots trashing Chicago in Transformers 3 (This is way cooler) But other great action scenes come throughout the movie. one of my favorites is the scene at the beginning where Loki steals the Tesseract/Cosmic Cube and takes down a whole bunch of S.H.I.E.L.D agents including Nick Fury and Hawkeye. Also, The plot is fairly simplistic but what really makes this movie shone is the character dynamics. So final verdict: possibly the best movie of the summer of 2012. Assemble and go see it."
395,491,0.21967529,0.35909086,0.42123386,7,Another over-the-top cartoon for Hollywood to pander to...,"I didn't like The Hulk movies, they were awful, both in story and execution. Ironman was excellent but Ironman 2 dropped off. Captain America was entertaining if a bit far fetched. Thor was ludicrous. I didn't hold up much hope for Avengers Assemble but i still saw, and enjoyed it, even if Scarlett Johansen shouldn't be within 1000feet of these movies ever. Jeremy Renner and Robert Downing Jr saved this film. Renner is a top notch action star in the making. That aside, the Avengers is beautiful to watch, great effects, decent story but the ending was lame compared to the build-up and, having watched how Christopher Nolan realistically and magnificently does his Batman movies, this isn't even a close second to them for me."
396,492,0.02397545,0.2053867,0.7706378,8,Superhero movies keep getting better & better. They realized good acting & writing are needed. This is worth the hype. I say A-,"""There was an idea to bring together a group of remarkable people, so when we needed them, they could fight the battles that we never could."" After the God Loki finds his way to Earth, steals the powerful Tesseract and is close to fulfilling his goal of destroying the planet there is only one group that can stop him. After years of recruiting Nick Fury's (Jackson) team is ready. This is a movie that people will pretty much just watch without any prompting or reading reviews because of the hype and build up but I'll do one anyway. I have to start by saying that I never was a huge comic book movie person. When they first started being made it was pretty much just how much stuff can we explode and how cool can we make it look. Over the years they have been getting better and better and I think the success of the ""Batman"" movies by Christopher Nolan has raised the bar. He has shown that a real story, plot and great acting can make a typical ""popcorn"" movie into a legitimate movie. All the years of honing the genre have led to this. Not only is this a fun movie to watch but it is also a great acted movie and everyone is perfectly cast. Downey is the leader but is in no way overpowering and this has the feel of a real ensemble cast movie in the way that ""Crash"" did. After years of movies like the ""Fantastic 4"" and ""Spiderman"" they finally realized the key to not just making a good comic book movie, but a great movie period. Good acting and writing are needed. Both are on display here. I have said for years that I am not a comic book movie fan...this movie may have changed my mind. Overall, not just a good and fun comic book movie but a good a fun movie...period. I give it an A-."
397,494,0.080507465,0.3019053,0.61758727,7,"A very solid action/superhero flick, at best","Now I'm always getting a ton of hate for my opinion on The Avengers, so I'm prepared for many people to disagree with me. To start off, I am a huge Marvel fan, have been since I was young, so I'm not someone going in without a clue.Avengers is a solid superhero movie, with superb acting from much of the cast (it's fairly unanimous Ruffalo and Downey Jr. stole the show), great visuals, and terrific action choreography. But I still believe it to be overrated, and that is when people jump out at me. I'm not saying it's a bad film, I definitely enjoyed the viewing, especially in theatre. I couldn't really see myself caring to see it again though, not to say I would never; I just don't have a strong urge to. I am still excited for the sequel, there's no doubt about that, it will most likely be more of the same, and enjoyable. The thing about Avengers, and all of the other Marvel Studios productions (Thor, Captain America, Iron Man series) is that I don't feel they do what Christopher Nolan's Batman series has accomplished - and that is transcend the superhero genre. There is so much emotion and depth to both Batman Begins and even more so The Dark Knight, that Avengers could not even hold a candle to them. I suppose you could argue that would be due to the fact that the source material might be better for the Batman films, but I still feel the overall atmosphere of the Marvel Studios movies are less character development, more poppy in your face action sequences and quirky one liners. Again, that is not to say that is a terrible thing, it just doesn't bring Avengers, or any of the others up past 'good' for me, they do not reach great. Some people argue that the character development is great, and although I will agree that it's much better in The Avengers than any of the other Marvel films - because it had to be - it still doesn't reach compelling to me, just entertaining."
398,495,0.036711607,0.15985629,0.80343205,9,The Avengers (2012),"It's finally here. OH MY GOD. As a big comic fan it's amazing to see how far the genre has come in the last decade. We finally get star studded spin-off featuring a large cast of some of the greatest characters. If you've been living under a rock, then you may not have noticed that over the last five years, Marvel have been churning out their big hitters and building up to The Avengers. Iron Man, Thor, Captain America and Hulk join forces to stop Thor's brother, Loki and his alien army. Sure, the plot is simple, but that's what we want for a big smackdown. For any team we need a great leader and Marvel have found the best in Joss Whedon. With his familiarity with large ensembles he effortlessly gives every hero their due. He also manages to flesh out characters in very short scenes. We get a sense of Stark and Potts relationship, some back story for Black Widow and Hawkeye, the confusion of Rogers and so forth. He does his best work with Hulk. I've loved every incarnation of the Hulk so far, so I was wary of Ruffalo's performance. He captures it perfectly, going for a more nervous and geeky Banner. When the Hulk is unleashed, Whedon makes sure to not take it too seriously. Hulk gets the biggest laughs in this surprisingly comic film. The action is fantastic, with a number of exciting set pieces. The final battle has so many wonderful character moments immersed in the action, and they really do work as a team. There are a couple of shortcomings. The alien race is just pathetic, and never really feels like a threat. Add to that the whole mother ship destroyed and every alien dies plot convenience. The film lacks any real threat. We hear about the many people Loki kills, but we never see anything that relates to this. Without seeing the sacrifices made it's hard to get too involved. There are also a few moments where characters just happen to show up. These are things that are minor nitpicks. After all, the only way to do a perfect Avengers movie would be to have an unlimited budget and unlimited running time. What it does achieve is simply amazing and very exciting for the future of superhero films."

What it does have is a director who understands that the source material is essentially comic book fluff. None of these characters have the depth that Batman or the X-Men do, but they do have cool powers and cool personalities that make for a decent story and some great action set pieces.The most epic of these sequences takes place in – you'll never guess, never, not in a milllion years – New York City! While the scene lacks originality in location, it does make up for it in sheer excitement. Iron Man goes rocketing around town in spectacular aerial battles with the Chitauri, who are as disposable as the Foot Soldiers from Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. Hawkeye sits on a perch on top of a building and casually snipes more Chitauri out of the air with his bow and arrow. The Hulk, well, he smashes. His chaotic leaping and random crushing of the puny aliens is spectacular to watch. Oh, and, a few of our good guys end up battling Loki at random points as well.Go to http://thethreeacts.wordpress.com/2012/05/11/the-avengers/ to read the complete review!"
400,498,0.8547681,0.11887156,0.026360312,6,Not the Best movie ever seen!,"I am really disappointed by IMDb! It cannot be that a movie is rated with 9+++ before it actually goes to the screen. I did not want to watch this movie when i saw the trailer. Unfortunately i read Reviews and got misled by this high rating on IMDb. I expected much but i got an average action movie. The movie was not entertaining by profoundness. It was an 2 1/2 hour orgy of visual fireworks. This may be awesome for under aged persons but this definitely is not satisfying an audience that wants a story, good character description and most important a movie which is not completely foreseeable.IMDb should consider that their rating system lacks crucial information about the age of the Reviewers. I give 6 of 10 because the visual effects were great but thats not what defines a good movie."

It had very little profanity and no blood except for the part where Loki, Thor's brother takes somebody's eye out with his staff. It does not show up close view but anyway I would tell all my friends about this film! Don't take kids under 7 to see it just for the action part of it! I will make this promise, if you see it you will love it!!! If you do not love it, sorry movies are not your thing! Also a shout out to Robert Downey, Jr.( aka. Iron man) he did great! But the mightiest Avenger is THE HULK (DON'T MESS With HIM) I know I wouldn't!! Marvel you did it again very great movie!!!! Thanks for reading. I am Alex Adams for Movie USA!!"
