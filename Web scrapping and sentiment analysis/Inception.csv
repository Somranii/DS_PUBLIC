My Grade won't change-it's the same for all Nolan movies-sheer 10!"

The directing was outstanding, there were only about two moments, maybe three seconds in total, where i noticed that visual effects were being used (of course defying gravity is pretty difficult). The plot was very pleasingly intricate, with a twist-and-turn, keep-you-on-the-edge-of-your-seat type feel. I noticed that this film had similarities with DiCaprios thriller Shutter Island (which i also enjoyed very much)seeing as it left you wondering what was real and what was not. It's great to see a movie with a thick and emotional plot and not just grenade-throwing action heroes who achieve greatness in the end.Inception also has a very well-composed score, which to me was the finishing touch to a perfect movie. If you're thinking about seeing Inception, definitely go! Even though i was fortunate enough to see a free show, it is worth every penny you pay. Truly unique, like nothing i've ever seen before. Christopher Nolan certainly covered new ground with this film and wasn't afraid to leave us hanging with a spectacular ending."

A friend claimed Inception is a ""thinking person's movie"", but a thinking person will realize that it is only masquerading as a thinking person's movie. At bottom, intellectually, ""there is no there there."" Add to this that someone clearly believed the film needed to be pumped up with overwrought drama to qualify it as a ""summer blockbuster."" I couldn't wait for it to end, and when it did, the intrusiveness of the loud, schlocky music over the closing credits seemed to crystallize all the incipient negative feelings I had been having throughout the movie. I hope that this director will go back to doing smaller films that do not stretch his concepts beyond what they can support."

And so childish. And Tiring! How can it be that everyone likes this movie. It's absolutely overloaded with bizarre and completely arbitrary turns of plot that have to be explained for about 75% of the movie. No character! No excitement, I could not even tell who were the bad guys. And yet again a few seconds of Michael Caine to camouflage the complete cardboard appearance of the entire cast! What is the meaning of this movie? What is it about? Uhhh???? Its internal logic is utter bullshit. Its emotional significance is zero, empty, frightening.Can please somebody agree with me, I feel so sad.Kurosawa come alive!"

This movie is the most un-dreamy movie ever made, and as critics have said since the beginning of moving pictures, watching a movie is like dreaming with your eyes open. Colin McGinn covers this in great depth in his book ""The Power of Movies"", in which he discusses the spatio-temporal discontinuity in films: the camera can record a given scene and then leap to another place and time entirely. This is what movies do! Nolan treats this heavy-handed hopping about as if he's discovered something. What he's lost is the mysterious, moody, enigmatic quality of dreams, the tremendous emotional wallop. ""Inception"" is so detailed, so measured, with constant explication, that nothing is left to the imagination. How ironic is that? And to fill a movie about dreams with carefully designed car chases, gun battles, and mayhem of all kind...it's anti-dreaming. I've never watched a film so awake, so aware of itself, so full of itself. A hundred years from now when cultural historians look at this era of Runaway Bigism - Big Government, Big Corporations, Big Bodies! - they can use over-blown and spiritually empty films like this (and ""Dark Knight"") as good examples of what ruined the country. Wretched excess."

There's a germ of a good idea here. (In fact, there are germs of 9 good ideas here. But they are all poorly thought-through and badly realized.Nolan draws on Orpheus (DiCaprio) trying to save his doomed wife (Cotillard) from Hades (here: Limbo.) There's Ariadne (Page) who helps Theseus (DiCaprio again) thread through the maze of the Minotaur. There are riffs on Jung's archetypal projections and Freud's ""unconscious"" blah blah blah as if Nolan opened up a book by Joseph Campbell, sprinkled in some ""psychological ops"" nonsense...and said ""I am BRILLIANT!"" Well, Nolan started with great ingredients. But they're all poorly mixed, half-baked and layered precariously on top of one another.Bottom line: this is a truly dreadful film which will be hailed by people -- who because they're confused -- will think it's JENIUS! The only good thing? I finally understand how Scientology caught on."

It is a film about movies and dreams and reality, and what sort of life it is best to find when you leave the cinema and return to whatever you left to enter.
It is spectacular, and brutal, and enigmatic and disturbing.
It is beautiful and absorbing.
It is about one of my favourite characters ever to grace the screen.
I don't see it often, in case it's not as good as I like to remember it.
That is my secret, that I lock away in my safe in the basement.
That somewhere there is a perfect world for us all.
For some, perhaps it is in the cinema watching this."
7,15,0.5536534,0.35959387,0.086752675,1,Awful!!!,"We went to see this movie at an IMAX theater. After reading the initial reviews about the special effects and the cinematography, and seeing all of the trailers and special shorts on the film, this seemed like a sound choice. What an absolute waste of money! After reading the other user reviews, I can't help but wonder if we didn't watch a completely different film. All science fiction films require a suspense of reality as they are based on a future time, feature incredible technology which is currently beyond our reach, etc. Given that, most films try to put this aspect into some kind of context which makes the central premise believable or possible. Not in this case. This film's plot vehicle is something called is 'shared dreaming,' through which a third-party can access your dreams and unlock information you are keeping secret. It is somehow done by connecting the dreamers up to a devices contained in stylish briefcases and then - POW - they are in an apparent instant REM state, all connected together and journeying off in their dream world. Huh? It's just thrown out there and the audience is expected to just absorb the concept, accept it and move on to be wowed by all the special effects. A murmur of 'I don't get it' was heard throughout the theater I was in.Early in the film Dicaprio approaches a student played by Ellen Page, who is a student of his old professor and asks her to be an 'architect' and design his dream environments for him. The environments must have mazes and paradoxes. Now, most folks when presented with such a concept would be calling the nut house on a guy like Dicaprio, but Page's character just accepts the whole thing and dives in, having a whee of a time with the environment she creates, bending it and reforming it in visually impressive ways. There is no attempt, however, to sell this whole thing to the audience and it just doesn't work in any sort of context. As the team descends through layers of 'levels' of dreams, the whole thing just becomes more moronic and boring. Great visuals, lots of action, but it all just seems pointless.I would put this down as one of the worst movies I've ever seem. Beautifully shot, but with an empty, stupid plot."

When his beloved wife committed suicide in the past, he was falsely accused of murder and now he is an international fugitive that can not return to USA to be with his children. When Cobb meets the powerful Saito (Ken Watanabe), the executive offers a unique chance to him to clear his records. In return, Cobb shall plant an inception in the mind of the heir Robert Fischer (Cillian Murphy) to avoid that the company he had inherited from his father becomes a monopoly in energy in the future. Cobb lost the capability to build dreams and together with his partner Arthur (Joseph Gordon-Levitt), they team up with the trainee in architecture Ariadne (Ellen Page); with the expert Eames (Tom Hardy); and with the chemistry Yusuf (Dileep Rao) to enter in different levels of Robert's dream and plant the inception.""Inception"" is an overrated mess and my greatest deception in 2011. I do not understand the hype surrounding this film, probably the fruit of the market campaign of smart producers that lure naive viewers that seem that does not think and understand how flawed and stupid this story is. The plot is developed in fast pace to force the viewer to not think, with incoherent rules that do no make sense and that change in each layer of the dream in accordance with the intention of the writer. The best part of this film is the hilarious IMDb User Rating that reflects how brainless the Hollywood cinema has become in the contemporary days. My vote is six.Title (Brazil): ""A Origem"" (""The Inception"")"

Instead of taking advantage of this (lack of creativity? too scared?), the film confines itself to mirroring reality in every way - be it time, space, surroundings, physicality, ideas, or behaviours. Under the incoherent, made-up-as-we-go logic, the film is but a low-grade action film in a sci-fi disguise. The story line is laughably childish, the music is over dramatic and there's zero character development. It's a shame to see Ellen Page and Michael Caine's talent abused in this dribble. It's such a pity, really. In the right hand the same material could flourish and treat us to mind-blowing wonders and imaginations. Christopher Nolan has missed the point completely: dreams can be absolutely anything. Anything! We want to see rules bent and physics defied. But instead we were given the action sequence and plot from a 70s B movie. Entertainment-wise it's not that bad a film (admittedly there are far worse action films around), probably 2.5 stars if you leave your brain outside the theatre. But given the current unjustified high rating, I have to give it a super low one to tip the balance."

Once it is off the cinema, it will start dropping, as ""real"" people give the votes and not the dream-reviewers. 2) I actually believe in the perspective of the dead wife; the whole reality is ultimately a dream and a creation of our own consciousness. What bothers me is how my subconsciousness could create such a crappy and meaningless movie."

It is as if the film itself is trying to practise in real life its own concept: planting in the viewer's mind from the inception that it has extraordinary merit. This must be the ultimate film business gambit and possibly the most daring ever tried in film promotion history. Surrounded by mind-numbing images and eleven-dimensional sound you are told a hundred times every minute what a great film you are viewing. Just look at the audience when you go to see it (as I am sure you will): they looked bored and perplexed but have arranged their faces in expressions of seeming appreciation in fear of being thought of as square, to use and old beatnik term. This would be the dullest film I have ever seen, almost anyway, and everyone I spoke to - even strangers - after the showing said that from its INCEPTION they could hardly wait for it to finish. Money has scaled new heights of desperation to be made. Shame on all the actors who contributed to this disgraceful exercise in megalomaniacal money-making!"

Please, please, please ignore its IMDb rating - it's becoming more and more meaningless. The idea for the plot is actually pretty interesting and some scenes are original but that's pretty much it. Each and every character is one-dimensional and shallow, the political setting is such a cliché and ending is easily predictable. There is a lot of stupid and unneeded chasing and shooting, punching and kicking, very much like in cheap Chinese movies. Which is fine in itself if all that you expect is an action movie, but if you expect something more memorable, then just skip it in theatres and rent a DVD in a few months. While watching such movies there is feeling that it's made like a puzzle from predefined pieces. Each piece was seen million of times before and the whole does not add anything on its own. I wholeheartedly agree that shooting a movie is not easy, and nobody can probably generate enough fresh ideas to produce a masterpiece each time. This time Nolan produced a mediocre result, let's wish him next time to make less primitive and more interesting show."

Chris Nolan is rapidly becoming the director of his generation and I'm longing to find out what is he trying to say. He has established his technical power again and again but if I think of ""Memento"" for instance I remember the gimmick but not what the story was really about. I suspect the same will be said of ""Inception"". I'm not putting down, I'm just wondering. I left the theater full of questions and nobody could actually give me any answers. I'm not talking about the plot but at the way Christopher Nolan chose to tell the story. Leonardo Di Caprio is acquiring some extra gravitas as an adult presence on the screen.Loved Cillian Murphy, I always do. Riveted by Tom Hardy. Enchanted by Marion Cotillard.

Technically speaking, there was no true heroic character, as it was a bunch of technologically-advanced criminals and their victims. At several points during the movie I was pleading ""Go home! Go home!"" It had a decent idea but I have to think that Rod Serling (RIP) probably could have done a much better job with this and he would have done it in a shorter time. I really think the writers and producers could have made a tighter film with better and more interesting characters.

An absolutely amazing cast and incredible premise was almost wholly pushed to the margin by special effects and ""action"". My hopes were too high. Nolan was clearly out of his depth as far as intellect goes and totally blew the chance to pull off an epic, unprecedented dream heist flick.Dear Nolan, if you're reading this: You can give guns, grenade launchers and C4 to a cast of unknown actors, place them virtually anywhere and have them destroy everything in sight for two hours, and it would have been just as good as this movie.Thanks for ripping me off by luring me in with an allure that promised slick corporate spies engaged in mind games in surreal settings and instead taking it from a promising half-way point into a senseless visceral joyride that was quite literally the cinematic equivalent of van Gogh painting Starry Night then taking a bowie to it and slashing it to ribbons before the paint has a chance to dry.It's painfully clear that you wrote the script to allow you to stroke your ego with the most over-the-top action flick you could cook up. With the money you spent on all the great actors you employed for this, you could have hired a dozen great writers to develop a script that would have actually been worthy of their talent. You sir, simply WASTED it. I actually feel embarrassed for Michael Caine. That such a fine actor was dragged into this crap is sad. You could have just flashed a still photograph of his face for a few frames and it would have sufficed since you don't pause for even a second to develop ANY of the characters except for Cobb and anyone with half a brain was probably wondering WHY character development was so scant in a film that deals so heavily with the subconscious mind. No, I guess a car chase was more important. It's entirely beyond me why you tainted your ego-stroking action flick with a genuinely thought-provoking premise when all the ""smart parts"" flew over the heads of your target audience by a wide berth.tl;dr version: shallow, pseudointellectualist excuse for making an obscene, self-gratifying action flick. I hope to god you get your money's worth if you actually pay to see this garbage."

It's impossible for a youth to understand serious movie and this action-decorated replica probably helps them to see the original masterpiece. Actually, actors' performances are not very strong either, only Marion Cotillard tried to set an equality with her Academy Award prize. FX are interesting, but probably it's the only strong point in the whole film.

What a total disaster! This is one of those movies that make so little sense that people just assume they're not intelligent enough to ""get it"" and fall all over themselves praising it. This movie is not some revolutionary trend setter--does anyone remember ""The Matrix"" from 20 year ago? Also it sets up the rules of what's going on at the beginning. That's fine but they're thrown at you so fast and furious (with NO explanation) that I was totally lost. Then, after establishing the rules, they CHANGE them for no other reason than to confuse the plot and throw viewers off. THEN they introduce new rules when we're well into the movie! That's not clever or intriguing--it's playing with the viewers mind and deliberately making them lost and confused. To make it worse the acting pretty much sucks. Ellen Page is horrendous (and her character is never fully introduced or explained) and Joseph Godron-Levitt sleepwalks through his role. DiCaprio (who I THOUGHT was a good actor) is terrible. He gives yet another performance of a man who's tortured by some dark past and trying to get through it. He's done this many times before (""Revolutionary Road"", ""Shutter Island""). Can't he do anything else? Also when he breaks loose and start yelling I didn't believe it for one second and I couldn't take it seriously. I've seen that before! The admittedly great special effects can't help. I walked out after 90 minutes. The movie is constantly pulling the rug out from under the viewers and I got this smug attitude that the filmmakers were having a fun time playing with the viewers and thinking they were smarter than they actually were.

Is there no expectation any more that movies should have SOME plot, story, sequentiality, or plausibility, or are they just total indulgences on the part of the director? Rather than watching a compelling, evolving storyline that INVOLVES you and draws you in, instead we witness the work of 18 year-old computer whiz kids in front of their consoles, churning out meaningless, special effects displays. One feels like a bystander on the sidelines, and the experience of watching something like this is both boring and irritating. ""Inception"" is the most confused, convoluted, ridiculous assemblage of scenes ever put on the screen. At one point there were simultaneously 1. shots of people underwater in a van that had just gone off a bridge, 2. men shooting each other with machine-guns while skiing, 3. men fighting each other in a hotel hallway while floating in the air defying gravity, and 4. a scene with Leonardo DiCaprio at his house talking to his wife. The camera kept alternating quickly between each scene, but each one had nothing to do with the other. It was like watching a movie preview, with random, unconnected scenes thrown out in rapid succession, meant only to entice you to see the movie. Not only did scenes bear no connection to one another, they also had no relation to the scenes preceding them, and thus there was absolutely no follow-able story line at all. There was nothing but c.g.i. effects meant, I suppose, to ""entertain"" us. Do movie makers not realize that special effects, in and of themselves, do not hold one's interest if there is no connection between them and some conceivable storyline? You might as well be watching a cartoon. As with a cartoon, unless you're five years old or brain-impaired, you would become bored within five minutes, because there's no ongoing, developing story demanding your attention."

Acting is bad, dialogue is worse, and entertainment is zero. I was actually forcing myself watching and waiting to see the point of all this... Couldn't bear anymore when my watch showed that 50 minutes have passed. And I love Science Fiction movies. I even from time to time enjoy watching a B rate movies, which make you relax and give you 2 hours of entertainment away from everyday stress. This one just made me checking my watch every 2 minutes to see when it would finally end... Basta!!!Don't waste your time and money!"

That old shoe Leonardo and some other soulless characters talking and talking and talking. I just wanted to stand up and shout: SHUT UP AND GIMME A REASON TO WATCH!And after noticing the whole idea was stolen, I really had a hard time not to leave. But I gave it a shot.Nothing changed, three scenes switching all the time: falling car, dude fighting in hotel, a group of Chuck Norrisses fighting in snow. And that for an hour. Whee whee special effects! OK, but special effects should be the cherry on the delicious ice cream, not the ice cream itself.Do yourself a favor and save your time and money.

My only explanation is that this deadly dull movie put everyone else to sleep and they thought they saw a better movie. The performances were very lackluster and the actors all (except for Tom Hardy) looked like they were performing in their sleep.There was no reason for any of the characters to be involved in this plan from a personal motivation reason, and their behaviours were completely arbitrary. Did they get paid for their time or was there some other reason to what they were doing in this scheme with the main character? I felt no connection or empathy for the main character or his motivation. There was no sense of unreality or mystery one would expect in a dream. The action sequences were dull and seemed to be just shooting people because there was a perceived need to have some gun fire.

The only people who would like this movie are drama majors who enjoy debating the deep meaning of every scene over their cappuccinos and scones.

After seeing it for myself, I thought it was a good film, but not as good as I was led to believe. Out of the Christopher Nolan movies I have seen, Inception didn't wow me as much as Memento and The Prestige, and it is one of my least favourites of his so far. Does that mean the film is bad? No, I am just saying I do not think it is Nolan's best as I have heard people say.My main problem with Inception was the lack of emotional attachment, I do understand completely anybody who says it is emotionally cold. Particularly in the characters, they are written and acted well, but not much is done to make us empathise with them and their predicaments. I loved the idea of the story, it was clever and somewhat original and it did start very compelling and intriguing, but as the film progresses it does become rather convoluted and I found myself losing a little interest. Also, the pace is uneven, as the characters became more cold and the story more convoluted, the film really does start to drag until the conclusion where the film does thankfully pick up.Inception despite these faults does have a number of strengths, especially the beautifully crafted production values, dream sequences and effects and Nolan's superb direction. Hans Zimmer's score is incredibly good too, while powerful and haunting it rarely becomes overbearing, while the dialogue is on the whole clever and thought-provoking. The acting is generally very good, both Leonardo DiCaprio, with a more hardened persona which has grown even more, and Ellen Page give strong performances and while Marion Cotillard is underused she is pretty good as well and Cillian Murphy I think gives the best supporting performance as he is superb.Overall, Inception is a generally good film but not as good as it is lauded to be. 7/10 Bethany Cox"

While keeping a straight face, actors deliver lines such as ""dreams within dreams is too unstable"" and ""if we get killed we'll be lost in limbo till our brains turn into scrambled egg."" DiCaprio and company supply the ham. This movie tells us that ten hours of real time is equivalent to one week of dream time. That explains why this nightmare of a movie feels like it goes on for two days despite the running time of two and a half hours. And if one falls asleep while watching, the only way to resume one's normal life is to limbo under a totem pole."

Maybe I'm being too harsh since it's the best blockbuster in the last two years, but lets be honest. The first half of the movie is drowning in clichés and the rule 'show, don't tell' is not being utilized at all. Am I the only one who finds those tedious dialogues when they explain the whole plot (as if we were ten year olds) - really annoying? The real people in those situations would talk and react completely differently. That makes the character interactions and conversations barely believable and just empty.Also, actors who play Saito and Mal are really destroying any credibility of the drama and tension movie has. Saito (besides being a Morpheus wannabe) always talks as if he was simply happy he remembered the lines. And why, oh why do they have such unnatural, bad and forced accents? Ellen Page was a bad choice too (another cliché - younger student learns everything sensei has to say in 2 min and then teaches HIM a lesson). DiCaprio wasted his talent here, his powerful acting was ruined by the forced tension of the movie and a lousy soundtrack (which apparently never stops).The second half of the movie was better and combined with the end gave a certain satisfaction in terms of mental food. Nolan really is a master of plot and king of moments - unfortunately this is obviously becoming his biggest weakness. The overall impression is: it could have been a LOT better. It's not awful, but giving it a 10 and calling it a benchmark is just ridiculous."

This is simply the most overrated film after Nolan's Dark Knight, supposedly intended to represent a pinnacle of intellectualism, originality, and ideas never before even hinted at. But, all in all, this is nothing but two and a half hours of utter and sheer nonsense, a real viewing terror, a debasement of a genre! It is in the limitless realm of quasi-Freudian, or is it Yungian ?, philosophy, e.g., a dream fixing, and the main actors are faced with a difficult task of deciphering the way to create the dream within the dream within the dream, and when you expect to see some true scary Freudian elements or dream symbolisms of destruction and, God Forbid, sex, no, you are left in the cold with your feet dangling in the aforementioned 'within loops', as sexuality, as we all know, is the source of all the modern evils, and as this film is intended for all and sundry, e.g. like a pleasant, 'wellness ' relaxation after a really exhausting 3-hour shopping spree, the family must let some steam off in the nearby cinema, and ,voila, Inception is here with a correctly calibrated dose of illogical shooting and explosions ( at least I got to see the technology and weapons the Alpine units today use ), and ,yes, not only DiCaprio survives , everybody else fares the same, so have no fear, Nolan is here!

Stops. There were literally moments during action sequences where one character would pause and explain what was going on to another character, which of course was a ham-fisted way of explaining it to us. But even with all of that aggressive exposition, the movie never does make a lot of sense. The result is a lot of busyness -- oh, there's always plenty of stuff going on -- that's nevertheless pretty boring because it's never clear what all of the busyness is for.Nolan has done this to us before. Who the hell came out of ""The Prestige"" with any clue what that movie was about? And even his more narratively coherent films (like ""The Dark Knight"") suffer from a lack of humor and a burden of philosophical pondering that the premises can't support.

Now to the art work: the dreams that were created suppose to be convincing to the subject but they didn't even look that real on the screen. Artificial acting with backgrounds looks really plastic and gives away the ending right in middle of the movie. I would consider 2 hour 30 minutes is a big fail from editors and director for the amount you get from the flick. Christopher Nolan spent almost 10 years writing the screen play, but originality that he had in Memento is well overpowered by Hollywood glitter with no substance that new Batman movies are so full of.

In between these witless and thoroughly boring expositions, we get treated to the action clichés from every Bond movie that has ever graced the silver screen in the past 3 or 4 decades while the pounding soundtrack gets louder and louder simply with every subsequent scene.Where was the conflict in this story needed to create viewer involvement? Who exactly were we expected to root for? Why was everything happening in this film without exception utterly implausible? Why do people find this movie to be complex when the film spends about 95% of the script explaining what is going on. And why wasn't this hapless script nominated for a couple of Razzies?The fans are right, I don't get it."

I have never felt motivated to write a movie review in my life. This was one of the worst movies I've ever seen! My favorite movie reviewer gave it 4/4 stars. I am baffled - - I really feel like I'm missing something... although there seem to be many out there that have the same thoughts I do. Thanks for confirming my opinions! I could tell within five minutes of the movie that I was not going to like it and that I wouldn't be able to follow it. Should have walked out then. I am the most sympathetic person to characters in a movie. I was amazed that I couldn't care less if all of the main characters were shot dead. There was zero character development. I felt a bit nauseous from all of the action and I really coudn't tell what was going on a lot of the time.

I decided to stay level headed because the previews did not look that great. I went into it with medium expectations, and it was still a huge let down. Honestly I would give it a 3/10 for its cinematography and effects. It lacks everything everything that makes a great or even a good movie. The characters weren't developed besides Leonardo's and they were all bland and uninteresting. There are about 4 different subplot-like events going on and it creates for the viewer to be very disconnected, you never sympathize or empathize for anyone or anything in the movie, let alone give a damn about its very uninteresting story. The story was all over the place dragged out and bland, I felt disconnected from the whole plot. Good premiss, cool idea, good graphics.... Story was border line awful, acting was just average for such good actors, the characters were bland and sucked, the dialogue got wacky and pretty out there and didn't even make sense at times. the cinematography was all over the place. These past 2 years the IMDb rating has been corrupted or screwed. This is not, not, not a great or even a good movie. One of my least favorite Decaprio and Nolans films. The Dark Knight must have got to his head. Could we see another lost director like Tarentino? Apparently not to general audience who are apparently mindlessly entertained and think everything that is confusing is wonderful."

The film was about 45 minutes too long. The concept is very interesting, but there are so many loopholes and unanswered questions and illogical contrivances that we both just shook our heads and enjoyed the scenery. I have to wonder where all of the high ratings for this flick are coming from. I am not buying that as many people loved this thing on the same par as Lord of the Rings and Godfather.

The acting was wooden, which is due to the bad script because each of these actors can hold their own elsewhere. The pacing is glacial. We are continually being preached at about the subconscious, but it's all like an Agatha Christie novel, with a surprise, unforeseen and unannounced deus ex machina just popping up here and there to wrap things up. Like, it's really complicated because there are these things called ""levels"" to dreaming and the subconscious. If the director spent ten years writing this script, he should get another job.

Even more telling than the gratuitous CGI effects was the clunky narrative device of having the characters explain in overly verbose dialog where & when each segment was taking place (levels, locations, psychological motivations, etc.).

I guess being under 20 helps, although I talked to some younger friends who thought the movie to be just as insipid, lame and boring as I did.I read that people find this movie's complexity to be one of its strong points. This is quite sad since it's about as complex as the basis of your average video game. I guess that same thing has set the standard to determine what is complex today in films and what is not. Complexity in my book has something to do with multiple layers, each with its own intrinsic appreciation, and is recognized rather easily. The effect namely being that when you miss a significant part of the story, like when watching a good detective, you no longer understand what is going on. I must have at least dozed off 3 times during Inception but wasn't even remotely challenged to work something out that wasn't already all too clear about 15 or 20 minutes in.The characters were unlikable and uninteresting across the board and the same rather goes for the whole of what the movie considers to be its plot. A James Bond type of story arc which doesn't really make the viewer care for it's outcome since such is already pretty clear because Nolan uses the same frigging formula. We got the secret agent, a pretty damsel, a world threat and a plethora of nameless villains with guns, some even on skimobiles! At any given point during ThaT particular scene, I expected a venerable Roger Moore to rush out from behind a snow covered spruce, cunningly herding his chasers into a trap of what appears to be 007's stretchable tie conjoined to and in between two trees.Inception is nothing more than the next action/chase time-waster laced with the compulsory CGI and endless fake-explanatory dialog as if it was breaking down a match between two chess masters.

This film is so wrong on so many levels, it's hard for me to contain myself. The rating and reviews are proof of nothing but one thing, society is now dumb. That may sound harsh, but after thinking my way through the childish attempt to delve into existentialism, the moral bankruptcy, the flat characters, the attempt at creating 'cool' then that is the decision I've reached.It failed to deliver on every single level, even the special effects were so in-your-face that even they became irritating (Surely if an entire street is both below, and above you simultaneously, wouldn't it go a bit dark?).If you want a high concept film then rent Primer, if you want a film to make you think, rent Waking Life or Fight Club, if you want excitement, rent The Bourne Identity or something, anything, just please don't see this film, unless you've never ever ever questioned the reality around you, and you're thick, then maybe you should see it...

Anyway, to sum it up: This film was a torture to sit through. Do the directors think that every audience member has an attention deficit disorder? The film tried SO hard to blast the audience away with special effects and quick editing every other 5 seconds that it forgot a storyline. Leading to my point, what the was the film about? I still have no idea, nor do I care to know. It was a confusing mess. And I could care less about any character in the film either. I was actually hoping to fall asleep in the film because it would have been a better well spent two hour dream than this nightmare of a film! But all the noise of the film wound up giving me nothing but a headache. They should have a discount for an aspirin on the back of the ticket because you will need one after seeing this film. For a real sci-fi film that is completely brilliant and moving, go rent MOON (2009).

I didn't have a chance to decide if I liked a character through who they were. Lead actor played his usual flat self. He reminds me of the Al Pacino school of acting graduate. I didn't care anything about him or his ""team"".There were so stinkin' many visual flaws, goofs, and editing mistakes I lost count of which ones I would start with after the movie.The best thing about this movie is that I had a free pass given to me by my boss!"

Dreams are misconceived as just a version of reality with some CGI tricks and so we move through conceptual layers rather than anything that might reasonably be passed off as subconscious states. Any ambiguity about what is real and what is dream merely has us guessing about whether any of Nolan's crafted layers of so called consciousness actually matter at all beyond supplying opportunity for clever-clever editing sleight of hand gimmickry.To See Cobb (Di Caprio) and Mal (Cotillard)poncing about in their mental construct with a hand wave that its ordinariness is due to their fondness for modernist architecture (serial reiterations of skyscrapers worthy of a Hanna-Barbera loop)puts paid to any claim that we are witnessing the like of surreality we visit in our sleep. Dreams in this film are nothing but different locations arrived at by means of taking a pill. We sure don't get to see Wonderland.All this leads us to wonder about the entire premise which turns out to be nothing more than a bunch of corporate malarkey. Absorption into the plot rather depends on the audience buying into the elaborately technical internal logic about who has to be where and doing what in various levels of a subject's mind to perform the exercise at hand. That's your mission should you accept it.So if you happen to swallow the director's pill at the outset then Nolan's fake world will draw you in -James Bond's Impossible Oceans Infinity. Take the pill that powers your critical judgment and for a couple of ours you'll find yourself staring at some overblown money drain that invites you to consider the deception that marketing and production gloss can pull off."

Man, what a huge let down. I guess you can't blame Inception for expectations and for the crap that came before it but those factors may have led to the disappointment. People labeling this film as smart are doing nothing but exposing their own ignorance. Either that or else, they're exposing their own vast imagination because they must have filled in scenes in their own head to compensate for this films obvious shortcomings. There was no thought put into the dialogue and the effects are certainly awful. The action scenes are weak simply because they scream cartoon. I know they have the ""Matrix excuse"" that lets them warp reality but the CG is too bizarre for my taste. The shocking thing is that most of entire movie lacks real energy and especially lacks heart. Anyone else think there was little chemistry between the stars? Everyone besides Leo seemed to intentionally deliver no personality or charisma. I knew Nolan was going for an Indy-bizarre flavor. So, I expected little character development but I did expect to care about something or someone in the film. That really never happens. What a shame.Can filmgoers want to love a film so much that they block out how bad the film turned out? Or, will they be jaded holding it up to impossible expectations? Maybe my expectations were too high but I was greatly disappointed by this movie.

All along the movie the actors kept explaining things, and that killed the integral.

While DiCaprio's role here may be reminiscent of that in his earlier Shutter Island, there's no question that he anchors the movie with a perfectly calibrated performance that is equal parts intense and heartfelt. The rest of the supporting characters fill out their roles just as vividly- Joseph Gordon-Levitt radiates confidence and suavity, Ellen Page displays suitable wit and grit, and in particular Marion Cotillard exudes both sultriness and danger in an edgy yet eventually heartbreaking performance.But ""Inception"" is Nolan's vision through and through- and in fact, a visionary director and a master filmmaker at that. Many years Nolan spent refining his screenplay, and it shows in the great detail and complexity that makes ""Inception"" both an intellectual and visceral enjoyment- just take the names of the various characters, each of which have a special significance. With ""Inception"", Nolan invites you to open your mind to possibilities- possibilities of alternate realities, of complexities beyond the conscious mind to grasp and most importantly, of the power of imagination. It is that rare gem of a film that is so multi-layered, so profound and so fascinating that you'll want to experience it again immediately after you've seen it- just so you can fully appreciate its genius."

As most of Leonardo's movies are good this one is even better! it will blow your mind, so yes i recommend everyone should see it even if you like Leo's work you will still enjoy this movie. Moments in the film keep you at the edge of your seat waiting to find out what happens next. I fell in love with this movie because of its originality and the imagination that took in to realizing this movie, Christopher Nolan has yet again made another great movie. All the cast members did an amazing job with Inception. Thank you for making this movie, I'm sure i will see it plenty more times!"

It's as if all the stupid action movies and (romantic) comedies Hollywood is churning out regularly have led to a yearning for something more profound... though the big guns and larger-than-life stars are still not to be missed, of course.This one's in the same league as ""Matrix"", though much more elaborate in its twisted ways. (Just listen to the constantly exchanged plot explanations between the characters, which get unintentionally funny after a while.)

The one they sold the film on.Oh yeah. The last rant....i cant stand films where they introduce rules and details that only apply in the next few scenes. It so annoying and predictable. They do that a lot in this film.So anyway. I left asking myself and the other people I saw this with why this film is so overrated and there are a lack of bad reviews about it. We concluded its one of these trendy films that are meant to be clever and intelligent. I think people will be afraid of saying bad points about this just in case it suggests that they don't understand the concept. I for one did understand it, I just didn't like it. I certainly don't think it deserves 9.1 out of 10.My suggestion....just go and rent Matrix or Minority Report or something like that. Clever, visually brilliant AND enjoyable."

I have read a lot on dreams and will tell this with certainty that their efforts to humanize the screenplay are all in vein however taking advantage of pseudo-isochromatic charts. Are we really expected to take shots like this seriously? I can no longer ignore my feeling that we are close to the end of rich cinematic era. As a matter of fact in many situations, being monotone is better than having bad intonation. The worst is when someone goes up and down too much on every word or idea, examples of which can easily be seen in Nolan's Inception which is no longer a commencement, I dare say.

Unfortunately, there was no post-film alcohol or busty blonde to dull the pain of this evening's experience. In my opinion, Insomnia was Nolan's only good film, and it was really the performance by Pacino that grabbed me. Nolan is a talented version of M. Night Shyamalan, i.e. the Kings of the Twist Ending. This is a pseudo compliment. I don't think Nolan is brilliant nor a great filmmaker. This movie didn't scream intelligence, though it really tries. In addition to making Nolan even more wealthy, I hope the side benefit of this film's success is studios taking on more high budget pet projects that aren't designed to sell happy meals or sequels.

It never plays down to the audience, in fact, it assumes the audience is intelligent. Inception tells the story of Dom Cobb (Leonardo DiCaprio) as a thief with the rare ability to enter people's dreams and steal their secrets from their subconscious. His skill has made him a hot commodity in the world of corporate espionage but has also cost him everything he loves. Cobb gets a chance at redemption when he is offered a seemingly impossible task: Plant an idea in someone's mind. If he succeeds, it will be the perfect crime, but a dangerous enemy anticipates Cobb's every move.This movie is challenging, but always in a fun and inventive way that keeps you captivated. It is an updated 40's crime drama with a technological twist that just works. After the fight scene in the hallway, you will agree with me that Christopher Nolan will no doubt take home a few Oscars this year. Sound Design, Cinematography, best Original Screenplay, Director and Film unless something monumental is released between now and then. One scene alone should get Nolan the Oscar, and that being the city folding back on itself.

Even more illogical is the fact that if the ""Architect"" can create stairs, doors, or even an entire dream environment at will, why can't they fly, destroy anything they want any way they want, or make themselves invisible. At least in the Matrix Neo could fly.The movie just contradicts all of its own rules. People were falling all over the place throughout different dream states but no one woke up, even though a sense of falling wakes you up. Even worse was the supposed technology used to put everyone in the same dream. I don't even want to get started with that one but a pair of ear-buds just will not do it.

Inception does the same thing for action movies, the action sequences are held together with a plot that pretends to be complicated, but in reality is wafer thin and yet full of holes that you could put Incepton's entire budget for special effects into each one of them.

But only director Chris Nolan knows what it's all about and I don't believe I'll find out all the explanations until I get the DVD commentary.It's a heady mixture of sci-fi, comic book stuff and fantasy and all of it is focused on the mastery of dream invasion in order to gather secrets held in the human mind. Foremost among the players is LEONARDO DiCAPRIO, playing his role in a very authoritative manner with no shortage of barking orders and furrowed brow, all highly intense, as he gathers a team around him to investigate the dreamscape.There's plenty of action along the way, interspersed with quieter moments of explanatory dialog so the audience has at least some semblance of what's going on. But the whole concept of the story lacks the kind of credibility that would have made the film more engaging than it really is.Credit the actors with doing their best despite the fact that none of them have roles that are fully fleshed out. And this includes Joseph GORDON-LEVITT, ELLEN PAGE, TOM HARDY, CILLIAN MURPHY, KEN WATANABE and TOM BERENGER.If you're a MATRIX fan, you'll love this one.

Every idea in modern society seems to diminish the natural ability of people to dream and to remember what they dream. A film like this exploits the natural interest people have in dreams to tell an impossible story. As entertainment it is passable, even interesting...as information on dreaming it is not only worthless, it takes the mind away from any hope of effective dreaming. This is the toxic nature of the film-making experience, where we see reality in such a skewed and unreliable way that we no longer understand reality. Human society has surrendered its powers to dream to the church, to the university, to the corporate paymaster and so modern life is for most people dreamless. Given an opportunity to bring some great idea about dreaming to the screen, the filmmakers instead make a fantasy that is complicated, over-acted and so unrealistic I am just amazed that so many dreamless people have given it such a high rating. Dreaming takes place inside the human spirit, real dreaming takes place among groups of people. But people no longer know this. Dreaming evolved in the human mind from the many thousands of generations people spent living and sleeping together...which they no longer do. As an experienced dreamer I think this film is useless. As one who likes a good film, I think it is useless. Modern people just don't get it, and this sadness is the major component in the new world order."

Most of all, like in every Nolan movie, the editing is crisp. There is no room for even a smile. Action is unique and highly entertaining; although make a note there is no adrenaline rush during any action scenes. This is where Nolan's problem lies. We would have experienced that missing adrenaline rush if he had taken some time to develop the supporting characters, in order to make us feel for them. The only characters I felt for is Cobb and Mal. Their love for each other is shown beautifully, I personally have never seen a relationship explored in this unique way. The only reason I can think why Nolan didn't spend time on other characters is because of the plot he had to first explain and then execute. The plot is hard to explain let alone execute, Nolan did a very good job given the short amount of time. At the same time he had to make sure he did not loose the audience in confusion. A job well done. Now, what I really like about this movie, is the IDEA. Nolan has this great idea for a movie about dreams. On the surface the movie is loaded with multiple tense narratives, but in the background he's also exploring how powerful the medium of dream can be. Also at the same time he maintains the through-line of the movie. Not letting anyone forget why we are watching this movie, why we should care the protagonist reaches to a conclusion. Without the strong through-line we would be lost like in dreams. I think the best actor in the movie is Marian Cotillard. She plays her part with such a beauty I just can't describe. Leonardo also convinces us to fall for his motivations and makes us want him to accomplish his mission. Joseph Gordon-Lewitt also plays his part brilliantly, he is very straight forward unlike the earlier mentioned actors. The rest of the actors are just fine. Everyone Needs to see this movie if not because it is the best Sci-Fi movie after Matrix, then for the fact that it is the best movie of the year. If only Nolan can make a movie with this tight narrative and make us fall for the characters at the same time; your heart will stop beating. 10/10"

However, in a few couple of years, these CGI effects will not be that impressive anymore, and then people will (hopefully) see how lacking this movie is for a good story and characters. The average moviegoer will love this movie, but if you like good movies in the sci-fi genre, you kind of expect at least some plot twists.

Transparent, easy-to-guess plot with no twists, ho-hum action scenes, and no real conflict. And the key to the main character knowing he's in the ""real world"" is that he has a top that never stops spinning?!?! Huh? Did anyone check the script to realize that perpetual motion belongs in the DREAM part of this movie?Clumsy film. I love sci-fi, love Nolan's other flicks, even thought DiCaprio was pretty good, but didn't make up for such boredom and nonsense. This is far from a ""masterpiece.""

Throughout this action flick – and that is what it truly is, despite its pretenses – I couldn't help thinking of the most recent James Bond thriller in which I lost track of who was who among the secondary characters because the identities they started with were revealed as false, but then the revelation itself was proved equally false (or at least dubious), to the point where you couldn't believe a word they were saying and ultimately you ceased to care. With ""Inception"" we get a lot of technical jabbering from the mouths of Leonardo DiCaprio, Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Ellen Page about what everything means or might mean as they ""share"" and ""engineer"" other people's dreams in order to infiltrate their subconscious to achieve their corporate goals. These dream states are filled with the usual action staples of racing and crashing vehicles, explosions and the liberal use of automatic weapons, accompanied here by huge crumbling cityscapes (less effective than the more modest melting away of various smaller environments in ""Eternal Sunshine""). There is nothing particularly dreamy about writer-director Christopher Nolan's dream world; aside from a few interesting computer-generated images like a whole city appearing to fold over upon itself, none of the effects stick in the mind or affect the viewer's juices. Marion Cotillard contributes her trademark broken heartedness. Page gives the same performance we are familiar with from her telesystems commercials. Cillian Murphy emotes richly as the kidnapped son of an energy industry magnate. The heaving score by Hans Zimmer sounds like hundreds of others."

I felt obligated to vote to bring this score down to reality. I've read the terms benchmark, intelligent, masterpiece and greatest ever. After seeing the movie I find those terms and the current rating of 9.2 insulting. Yes for some reason I feel personally insulted by this. Is this because I was expecting the world after the great reviews and was truly disappointed? Was it the fact that I believe most feel the movie wasn't that great but are jumping on the bandwagon? I'm not the most intelligent individual in the world and can't understand how anyone intelligent could actually enjoy the story line with so many obvious holes. All I know is these layers upon layers of poor plots left a sour feeling in my mouth. I've read the comment and agree this is 'a smart movie for ignorant people'. They do say ignorance is bliss. Keep rating this ten you smart folk.Overrated, unengaging and far too long (let me scream that from the roof tops) are my thoughts. I paid top dollar to view this in my lovely electric reclining leather chair being waited on hand a foot in a 'gold class' cinema and I wanted to escape the comfort of my chair after 30 minutes. Long and painful movie experience. I urge you to filter through the positive reviews and read some well articulated negative responses. I have chose to keep this post short and sweet and leave the well articulated responses to the well articulated (lord knows every second person here thinks they are a literary genius). I really did want to post a 1 out of 10. I am a realist though and I have seen worse films. On a positive note Leonardo DiCaprio, Tom Hardy and Joseph Gordon-Levitt were great. They boosted my score from a one to a three. Leo and Joseph finally went through went through puberty and were believable as adults. Give me back the 148 minutes of my life wasted watching this film."

It was great, but still, one couldn't help wondering, where would Nolan go from here? How could he trump this achievement? In fact, although his subsequent films have been praised, they've been less distinctive, but with 'Inception', he returns to his adventurous roots, producing a story that is even more audacious than 'Momento'; and unfortunately, the result is dreadful. And worse than the fact that it doesn't really work is the fact that while it is distinctive, it is distinctive in a very conventional way. Since his early success, Nolan has taken work from big studios, and 'Inception' is no exception; and the result is a Hollywood movie straining desperately to stand out, instead of something more truly independent. in spirit.To make the point in more detail, 'Inception' features a starry cast (I'm, afraid for me, the casting of Leonardo diCaprio has become a clear sign of a poor film with pretensions); an implausibly attractive geeky female assistant; loads of expository dialogue (at one point, it is explained that someone is the most powerful media baron in the world – i.e. they appear to be so powerful that no-one had heard of them); fast pace and Jason Bourne style camera work; sub-'Matrix' style ideas about the nature of reality, superficially intriguing and certainly confusing, but of little philosophical depth; extraordinary special effects; and above all else, a plot comprising an incoherent sequence of random set-piece scenes that seems constructed to showcase said special effects rather than because it makes sense as a story. It may sound like an intriguing idea to have the cast simultaneously fighting for their lives in seven different nested dream-spaces, but in fact, it isn't; multiplying the threat to the heroes only reduces the dramatic impact of each one.To give Nolan credit, he has made a wholly cinematic film; you certainly couldn't imagine this in book form. Sadly it's very hard to imagine it as a screenplay either, or as any sort of story. And it was story, not special effects, that made 'Momento' great; and while that story was highly unusual, it made internal sense. But less is never more in Hollywood; and sadly, more is often just a mess."

It's closer to mediocre, but I just can't resist the urge to lower its over-inflated rating.To be fair, Inception has a strong cast, inventive CGI, and an interesting premise. Nonetheless, the film ends up being surprisingly tedious and unaffecting. Images rush across the screen as jargon-rich dialogue whisks pasts your ears. The film's methodical score swells and swells until you can barely make out what the characters are saying. It's all so complex, but complex like a brainteaser or a riddle. If you concentrate very hard, you can decode the film's narrative trick of dreams within dreams within dreams within, well you get the idea, and multiple action sequences all taking place at once in parallel dreamscapes.But, what do you get for all of your narrative attention? Very little. The story is gimmicky and the characters are flat: you just don't care what happens to them. In fact, when watching this film, I did not feel as if I were watching characters navigate a story world. Instead, I felt like I was watching movie stars speak difficult dialogue while performing stunts.By the way, any movie that can make Joseph Gordon-Levitt seem less than fascinating must have something wrong with it. If you do not believe me, then watch Manic, Mysterious Skin, or The Lookout. Then marvel at Inception's ability to mask— or at the very least waste— his considerable talent.As for the movie's imagery, it is initially striking. Then, like the movie's narrative trope— a dream within a dream within a dream— it becomes simply repetitious. Whose dreams look so leaden and dull? And whose dreams are so relentlessly consistent and coherent? There are so many good movies that replicate the bizarre visual logic of dreams-- Vertigo, Badlands, The Last Wave, Videodrome, Blue Velvet, Until the End of the World. Has director Christopher Nolan ever seen any of these movies? Has he ever even had a dream? In short, Inception delivers some new cinematic tricks, but lacks emotional depth or provocative imagery. It's a notch above Hollywood's typical comic book based summer extravaganza, but only a notch."

Did earth manage to conquer what the Krells could not?Christopher Nolan wrote and directed Inception and though it gets a bit heavy at times, it still is an unmistakable masterpiece. Leonardo DiCaprio stars in this and he's essentially a cat burglar of the mind. His mission usually is to invade people's dreams and steal ideas which makes him an invaluable espionage agent. But Leo's also a wanted man.Some problems Leo has relating to his Id have forced him to rely on others to create dream worlds. He was working against Japanese billionaire industrialist Ken Watanabe and got caught, but then Watanabe likes his style and hires Leo and his team to do a job on the young heir to a communications conglomerate, Cillian Murphy. It's not to steal anything, but to plant an idea in his brain with the dream team. The film is essentially how DiCaprio and his crew go about this job with Watanabe incidentally along for the ride. And its how Leo has to deal with some real demons involving guilt that force him to rely on others.Very nice computer graphic generated special effects characterize Inception and it will probably earn an Oscar nomination next year in that category. Director Nolan gets his talented cast to read writer Nolan's dialog with verve and conviction. I truly hope this technology is not in our near future that would be a frightening thought."

I never critique a movie just because it does not make sense, I love quite a few extremely stupid b-movies which are far from making any sense. In my opinion, a movie can make no sense all right, provided it is still entertaining. However, this one does happen to make so little sense that it should be classified as fantasy, not sci-fi, as explained in detail in many ""Hated It"" comments here. And as for entertainment, Inception, a movie about dreams, ironically made me so sleepy I barely made it to the end.Basically most ""Loved It"" comments here posit this movie to be pure ""genius"" because it is so ""complex"" and ""multi-layered"". If you don't like it, you must be too stupid to understand all the supposedly mesmerizing, breathtaking and complex ""layers"" or ""levels"". In short, an idea that one can dream within a dream either ""blows your mind"" or you are stupid. Well, okay, maybe it's just me. I happen to have been reading sci-fi since my early childhood, plus virtually all the software code I write actually represent a complex and multi-layered virtual reality, so I'm personally not that impressed. Looks like the ""Loved It"" guys were truly ""mesmerized"" by the dream-within-a-dream idea though, must have been quite an intellectual shock for them. I'm not saying there is anything wrong with it, only that it's not necessarily a ""genius"" in 2010. I would probably be ""mesmerized"" if I watched Nolan's movie in, say, 1910 (or to be on the safe side, in 1810).The worst was the casting, Leonardo DiCaprio and Ellen Page are good actors, but their cute & cuddly faces in a supposedly dark and moody sci-fi movie? No credibility at all, that completely threw me off. That choice would be perfect if Nolan was at least shooting for so-bad-it's-good movie.

I think that in being a Hollywood blockbuster it had to tick a certain amount of boxes that are necessary for the monumental amounts of money that are thrown at it.The first 30 minutes I was interested by the concept and the pacing of the film. The concept of espionage within a dream is an interesting enough concept. I was very open and excited by the idea of going into the world of dreams with the characters. I wish they could have perhaps explored a little more and pushed the boundaries of the dreams. It seemed that time and space flowed a little too seamlessly. Perhaps Kafka's 'The Trial' or a more Cronenberg style would have helped.After the first 30 minutes it sunk into the normal plodding of a Hollywood blockbuster. Are we watching Mission Impossible or a film about dreams? Unfortunately the last two thirds of the film were more Mission Impossible. I couldn't help thinking of the could have beens.

There is no drama, there are simply empty characters mouthing nonsense about dreams and dreams within dreams. It steals from the Matrix and other movies, and does a far worse job with similar material than those better movies did.Perhaps the first full hour or more is little more than chat that is full of hot air and psychobabble but that probably a lot of people in the audience don't bother thinking about. Everyone's waiting for the special effects, which do come along, but when they do, you probably won't care what happens or for that matter, even know what is happening.

Everyone else in the ensemble cast is terrific with particular mention to Tom Hardy (get this guy more work).Unlike many reviewers I didn't find the story difficult to follow although rapt attention is essential, and Nolan has delivered a story which doesn't attempt to talk down to you as I felt with the Matrix instead it draws you in and delivers in the last hour probably the finest piece of film making I've ever seen.The end of the movie was met with rapturous applause and I realized my hands were shaking I had tears running down my face and sweat running down my back.

In my dreams I feel, I touch, I smell. I dream music and books, I dream people, despair, tears. I dream violence, pain, sex, even death.

Our consciousness is layered as everyone knows who thinks they have awakened, only to find themselves in another nightmare--then they awaken again. We know that the subconscious by nature is out of our control. There you have a wonderful premise. Now layer that further with people who can flip in and out and use this to their own ends. While confusing, it's exciting. The amazing thing is that the director/writer pulls it off. Every nuance and event is picked precisely for its effectiveness.

I admire Leonardo di Caprio as an actor, but if I ever see him in an action man-hero sequence again, I'll call Kate Winslet to squash him like a bug (in Titanic, she looked huge compared to him),he's just not believable in those roles (and I thought Charlie Sheen looked ridiculous in the 80' s and '90's) no matter how much he tries, sometimes it works sufficiently, sometimes it doesn't but the fact that he seems to look for those roles all the time, and what a shame, compared to his earlier roles.I'll just stop here, I've rarely received such a bad vibe from a movie. The incredible special effects (which i acknowledge with 1 point) only made it worse, since they were supporting crap."

My theory is that everyone that sees it just says it is great because they want people to think that they are intelligent. You may be intelligent, but if you fall for it you are not. The director obviously figured out the human psyche, knowing that people would say they liked it just because it is complex and they want others to think they are smart. Well it is not complex, they just made it ridiculous. It did not need to be so complex to get the one point the whole 3 hours made. It was not suspenseful at all. It might deserve a 3 or 4 but I give it a 1 for wasting my time and to help drag down the undeserving 9/10 that it has. I just now saw it because I didn't fall for the previews, I just saw it was in the top 250 so I decided to give it a chance. This just reinforces how dumb people are. The 10/10 ratings must have come from children and cognitively deficient individuals. Don't waste your time, and please don't buy or rent it. Download it off the internet, all you need is BitTorrent (free program) and then search ""Inception Torrent"" on google, the first hit is usually the file you need.

Fancy special effects, yeah, plenty many lots... but special effects do not make a film. It also needs a storyline that doesn't shoot in every direction, left, right, backwards and forwards throughout the entire film for lack of substance.OK, so the dude wants to plant an idea in someone's brain. Got that after a minute or so of viewing. And then what? It feels too much like a storm in a teacup.Frederic Dard (french novelist) used to describe futuristic gadgets by means of expressions like ""he's pointing a gloombobber with spiral condensing palchromium in my direction"" but, being a talented writer, he had the good taste of limiting such eccentric nonsense to a single sentence per book, whereas Inception is made up of nothing but that from beginning to end. Each time the dream-team runs into a potential nag, there comes a gloombobber out of a hat. Too predictable after a while. ""This can't be done in a three-dimensional space... no problem, we'll do it in seven!"" would be an adequate tag-line for Inception.I couldn't follow the storyline and am not convinced there actually was one. It reminded me of the Brownian movement observed at the surface of a pot of boiling water. It was so confusing that switching actors every two minutes for the part of the main character would have gone unnoticed in this maelstrom of nonsensical garbage.In conclusion I don't see any point in watching Inception unless you're extremely high on speed or a fan of special effects who doesn't give a whoopdeedo about well-constructed stories in the first place."

The reason for the delay is because I think Nolan is the most overrated director working today . I'm not saying he's a bad director just an overrated one whose films seem to rocket high up in to the IMBDb top 250 list . He is a good ideas man but like Michael Crichton for over 20 years the premise of his films aren't fully developed and his ideas often owe more to other people . The idea of a film taking place in reverse is as old as cinema itself believe it or not . INTERSTELLAR owes much to 2001 and an apocalyptic novel by John Christopher written in 1956 and with INCEPTION .... oh dear INCEPTION On a visual level INCEPTION is very impressive . We've all seen those nifty trailers with characters standing around in the middle of collapsing landscapes . This isn't really indicative of how the film plays out . Instead we have pretty boy character A meeting character B Character A : "" You know how when you have a dream blah blah blah ?"" Character B: ""Yes"" Character A: ""Blah blah blah"" and by the time pretty boy has explained the plot mechanics and exposition to character XYZ I felt like someone should be waking me up . Not only that but some of us are old enough to remember other - and dare I state better ? - virtual reality movies . At the end of the day INCEPTION reminds me of one of Steven Moffat's timey wimey twist turney tales from DOCTOR WHO that is trying to be too clever and at the same time ends up becoming a mess and the reaction of ""Oh my gosh what a very clever original idea"" from IMDb commentators leaves me perplexed"

There are myriads of far better films with lower scores. Let's get this score down.I have the impression that this movie started with a script which had a couple of scenes in the middle, and it was then written further to extend it to a beginning and an end. The mystery is why anyone bothered to try to have a coherent script in the first place. Plot? we don't need no stinkin plot. The basic idea of such movies is to show stunning visual and auditory effects, have characters hurtling along, mouthing dialog not meant to be coherent or even perceptible. Show em the technology, wind the characters up and get them moving-fast! Have Whoosh, whoosh, bam, bang sound effects and music to match, get a name star, and advertise the predictable and unchallenging goop as a transcendental experience.This one was interesting in places because of the visual tricks. Otherwise, I had trouble following it at times, as much because I couldn't care less about what was a dream or reality, whose dream we were in, or why this or that was happening. Explanations of the arbitrary dream rules (excuses to do various things) were the most transparent gobble-de-gook imaginable.Nothing in here had a dream like quality. The dream excuse was a gimmick to do things like play with gravity, time, etc.It is just another mindless action movie, just longer and with fancy justification. As such it is not bad-but not good."

But compared to THE MATRIX series, or say DARK CITY, this film can't hold a mental candle. Maybe it's because of the Christopher Nolan-DiCaprio combo, maybe because of a few very cool visual effects (like a city turned sideways or upside-down), but for the life of me I can' understand why this film is rated a 9 on IMDb. I guess this is what happens when everyone gets to rate, and ""everyone"" means...well, average film knowledge...and prejudice. Where is the OBJECTIVITY, people? The problems, you ask, as if you don't want to take my word for it? Well it put my son to sleep and darned near got me, for one. It's too long and moves too slowly, then suddenly heaps plot setups and twists on you in desperate attempt to try and make the convoluted thing make sense. Where I come from we call this bad timing. And in a film LIKE this, well, that's not a good thing. The script is terrible. Even Leonardo's acting is not up to his usual par, the little girl cast as the architect was too wrong, and on the whole this film is just not believable. That some actually say this is Leonardo's best work is troubling to me on so many levels.Just because you make a bus fall off a bridge in slow motion shouldn't give you Oscar mentionings, you would think.Terrible waste of millions, I gotta say, I being an admirer of both the genre and Leonardo. But, again, don't take my word for it; watch it for free somehow (don't spend hard-earned money on this dog, for sure), then let me know where I have gone wrong. I give it a 5 only because of the effects I mentioned (not unique in film, but well-done) and the A-1 supporting performance by Joe Levitt. HE did what he could, after all."

I laughed at the Kubrick tributes. Beyond that, the thing was too simple for words - but dressed up to be a deep and meaningful experience. You know you are watching a loser when an elevator takes you up and down the guy's consciousness. An elevator? Now who dreamed that up?World domination? A Japanese accent that is unintelligible? Cartoonish characters of all shades (to sell tickets?) Two female leads, one of whom is frighteningly out of whack with the film's storyline (she doesn't understand anything, but is designing the project!), and the other wandering through scenes meant to be scary but - hey, you need to be able to act first, and it would help to then act scary.This film is a mess - except for the avalanche and freight train."

The film is all about is all about stealing & planting ideas in people's mind by using their dreams.The idea of the movie is good but the bad screenplay, 2.5 hours length that drags really badly, plot holes & unanswered questions & Cobb's annoying wife ruined the whole movie.Inception is supposed to be a movie that requires multiple views to understand it like Memento but there is no way I will watch it again for the second time because it wasn't that confusing and it boring throughout. The dream sequences were not dreamlike and only the hotel dream looked cool. Cobb's wife was so annoying that I wanted to pull my arm out and constantly bash my head with it. There were so many unanswered questions like what year is the movie set in? Why does Cobb steal ideas and now he has to plant one? It was 2.5 hours long and they still couldn't explain anything.Inception isn't even original it is ripped off from a Japanese animated movie called ""Paprika"" which was out in 2006.I don't know why it is #3 on the IMDb top 250 it is not a visionary masterpiece or anything and it is only about 80% on rotten tomatoes and there are many great movies with 90+% on rotten tomatoes and they are not on the top 250 like Run Lola Run.It is nothing but an over hyped movie and the film makers must of written that ""Inception is good"" on a piece of paper and planted it in people's mind although it's not."

The people rating this movie with 10 stars are so infatuated with the fact that they had to think in order to understand the movie fully, they're looking past 2 things; a) they probably need to think to do a lot of things if understanding this movie required an immense amount of thought, b) this actually just isn't the one of the best movies ever created. The plot had loop holes and parts that didn't make sense, and sometimes the ""rules"" (per say) of the dream world weren't really put into use, and often broken.The reason I'm giving this movie 6 stars is because it is still nevertheless a good movie, but intelligent? No. Should it be the #3 highest rated movie on IMDb? No. Should the stupid people who think they're smart stop clogging the reviews and allow people who could think straight throughout the entire movie to review it?

This is actually my first comment here and its catalyzed by the imposing will to set one thing straight: It is an absolutely average Hollywood flick and the first that made me question Leo's decision. I became a fan of this excellent acting in the recent years but it was actually painful to listen to the randomly pulled together pseudo-scientific plot. If you know anything about what they try to make up you will start laughing or continue to watch and hope for the good stuff to start. The action was good and the movie definitely has it's moments but I couldn't ""enjoy"" it until the last hour.Watch it if you can be easily pursued into a poorly presented idea, believe it and be drawn into it.

This isn't brilliant, it is bizarre. It isn't entertaining, because certainly if you go for entertainment and have to spend the entire 2 hours and 28 minutes figuring it out you will feel cheated and bored, not entertained. How a movie like this gets so many high ratings is a mystery and makes me worry. Will all movies go in this direction? Maybe its a cult movie, maybe that's it. There is plenty of ""action"" (read, endless fights, car chases, etc.), and the sound track is Really Loud. At one point most of the characters are for some unclear reason in the same white space-like suits with white head gear that hides their faces. You see anonymous white suits battling it out.

This is how the movie is structured – they tell you and then reinforce. Kindergarten for adults. It is all very clear but you have to pay attention The problem is the action scenes are over the top. How many snow chases have you seen? There are bad guys that can't shoot and good guys who seem to be wimps that beat the heck out of the soldiers and thugs. This isn't real life.

Yes, Inception is clever, multi-layered, complex and intellectually challenging. It is also heartless. It struggles to stimulate emotion. Cleverness replaces impact. Di Caprio's one-dimensional acting reinforces this sterility. From the first shot of a grim face we get the whole range of grim faces in a grim performance. He is grim about his kids, grim about the folding graphics, grim about his team, grim about the task in hand. Of the Matrix- plus effect I did like the folding city, but the ending was portentous to the point of tedium. One very good litmus test of the quality of a film is to analyse how many times the main protagonists have to explain the plot and at what length they have to explain it. Several characters explain the rules of the dream within a dream within a dream construct at the heart of the movie, with increasing loquaciousness and qualifications. This isn't plotting and it fails to create a genuine narrative drive. Compare it to so many of the films that come below this one in the rankings, Twelve Angry Men, Seven Samurai, Goodfellas, Casablanca, Once upon a time in America, Citizen Kane for goodness' sake.

Caprio, in this movie is a kind of dream terrorist, who as a profession extracts information from people's mind. This is espionage of new times and he has become notoriously popular for this. However, for the last time when he undertakes a job of planting an idea into the mind of an heir to a giant business empire (Cillian Murphy ); things go wrong. I am disappointed by the script. The movie is conceptually flawed. First of all, how can you dream inside a dream, I mean how one transitions into next level of 'sleepiness'. Even if one could, why the machine used to coordinate the dreams also appears the same in the dream and works also. Why one would age in a dream; I thought in a dream the appearance of oneself is the mental projection of the memory of oneself. Same genre has been portrayed by ""Paprika"" beautifully and is much more consistent and meaningful than this version of a dream-control fantasy.First act was a bit interesting, but the plot goes haywire towards the end; lost in an attempt to incorporate useless actions scenes. Ending was as terrible as one would expect after watching the trifling second act. Trying to give an inconclusive end was a bit pathetic after what has been done to original 'idea'. There was no 'original inspiration' in this movie. By the end of it, I was in level 5.Certainly a bad one from Nolan. This not nearly as good as ""Following"" or ""Prestige"".

The story was very confusing.There seemed to be plot holes and loose story lines that were never really tied up. The concept of the film is very intriguing and you will leave the theater wondering what it was all about. However, the atmosphere of some of the scenes felt very similar to Shutter Island for me. I almost felt like Leonardo DiCaprio did not really have to act much as he was basically playing a character similar to that of Teddy Daniels. Hope he isn't going to spend the rest of his career playing that same character. It was also nice to see Ellen Page in something besides Juno. She can be more than a snarky, pregnant teenager. Also, The visual effects are extremely well-done.I am not a fan of Nolan's work. The Dark Knight was a film that I could never understand why there was so much hype. It was average to me, at best.

I was actually expecting something good, we were talking about Blade Runner (our benchmark) before watching it, dreaming it could get anywhere close to it. We were wrong The first 20 minutes of the film were OK, but after that the film revealed itself to be no more than a fast paced video-clip action film. The script is OK but has quite many flaws, the dialogs are so bad most of the time. It's like everything is not natural and the characters are forced to explain things and as we say in Spanish they use a shoehorn so the audience doesn't get lost I suppose. Nevertheless what they do is not that hard to understand and they could have simply done it in a way more clever way. The acting is extremely weak, if you are looking for the di Caprio from the aviator, departed, so on, forget about this film. I guess Leonardo did what he could with this piece of crap script they gave him. If this wasn't enough, the film has music playing behind almost the entire film, very common among the sci-fi action films of our time, maybe it's me, but I cannot stand techno music or whatever during the entire film. I guess you know what I mean. And last, the action, it has more action than needed. the last 45 minutes I was literally yawning and wouldn't have minded to leave the cinema. It was awful, gunshots, grenades, kicks and punches.... simply pathetic. Im sorry for Nolan, he made memento which is a great film and Dark Knight was also good, but this?¿ this is crap and if you like sci- fi and quality, waiting for a DVD release should be enough.

I know this isn't what most people are saying about Inception but I'm afraid this is the cruel truth about the film. There is simply nothing new here, despite the ""originality"" everyone has credited the film with. If you've seen The Matrix, Dreamscape, Total Recall, Blade Runner, or Johnny Mnemonic (to name but a few) then there is going to be little here to surprise you. The opening half hour of the film spends its time frantically throwing complex and very clunky exposition at you in a desperate attempt to explain the highly contrived rules of the dreamworlds which provide the backdrop for much of the narrative. The action is there, but as always, Nolan struggles to film it in an exciting way, generally pushing the camera so close to his subject that it is impossible to really make out what is going on. Even the dream worlds in the film are remarkably bland and unimaginative - apparently we all dream as if we are in a Hollywood high-concept film dominated by CGI. The small scale nature of most dreams is nowhere to be found here and nor is any of the fascinating strangeness and mystery associated with dreaming; apparently the subconscious only really expresses itself in our dreams by manifesting itself as a lot of rather tetchy people who try to beat up anyone who invades the dreamer's mind (sound at all like the agents in The Matrix?). There are of course some impressive visual effects along the way (for instance at one point Paris suddenly folds back on itself so that streets run vertically and upside down like something from an M C Escher picture) but these are calculated simply for spectacle and Nolan really misses a trick in picking up the potentially genuinely fascinating subject of dreams and the way in which they link to the fantasy world of films. I'm sure this will be popular with a lot of teenage boys who might be impressed with the cod-philosophy of the film, but if you've seen any of the films listed in the first few lines of this review or if you've read novels by Philip K Dick or William Gibson, you aren't going to find much to engage with here. Massively over-rated, incredibly tedious and a waste of an excellent cast who, in fairness, do the best they can with the dreadful screenplay they were handed."

Also Wordy, Incomprehensible Insertions about the Teams ""Method"" used here to Infiltrate and Control the Minds of Corporate Clients (now there is a group we can morally support).This is so Unnecessarily Complicated that it causes Viewer Fatigue, and by Proximation Sleepiness, early on and Waking Up or Recovering from that is not a Given. The Result is just not Caring about Anyone or Anything that is happening on the Screen.

It Bumps and Jumps from Dream to Dream and Layer upon Layer of Intellectual Gobbledygook that is so Very Uninteresting and Without much Pathos. The Music is forever in Swelling Mode and Ripples throughout and is Pretentious and Intrusive.In the End, some have trouble making it that far, there is a ""you decide"" Twist that is not really a Twist because, after all, You Decide.

Then I tried again to continue, because I thought it's not fair to rate a movie without watching it to the end. But then again, I'm not a masochist.This film is the perfect example of how movie success depends hardly on movie quality, but almost solely on marketing. The same happened with the Matrix a few years back. Farcical setting, totally unrealistic story, but great marketing: Box office success.You probably already know the deal, unfortunately I was unsuspecting before I tried to watch it: Getting into other people's dreams, creating a believable world in the dream where multiple dreamers can interact with each other, and in this way, collect important information from the mark. Of course the dreams also have dreams within, and it's hard to know what is real and when your're dreaming.Whatever. No idea why anyone would WANT to watch this, other than because of the hype. But the hype has very little to do with the quality of the film.This film's whole focus is on the farcical notion of creating dreams for people, and especially, interacting with other characters in the dream who are dreaming the exact same dream. If the film were not so consumed by this outragous technicality, and it had some character and heart, some sort of purpose, I could probably let slip the ridiculousness of the whole theme. I have been known to enjoy the odd sci-fi. But it lacks any heart, all it does is try to look smart.I find it grossly unfair that this junk rates above 9 on IMDb. However, my rating of 2 is not because I want to bring the total down, it is rather what I think the realistic rating is. And that 2 is a very generous score."

Nothing too special but it would have been a fine entertaining movie.

OK, the idea is nice, but the movie itself is just like any other Mission Impossible of Oceans Eleven franchise. It is a boring heist movie. Apart from that the characters are lame. DiCaprio plays the same person as in Shutter Island and the action scenes are completely out dated. I thought I was Watching an Bond movie from the 80's from time to time. And why did they have to explain everything. I'm not stupid. Just a quick run through and we could have started. Nolan took over an hour to explain everything..... Why.

Unfortunately, much of it is unnecessary and difficult to follow and takes the place of character interaction, character growth, and emotion. Inception is a gargantuan, cinematic meditation on dreams and reality. Zzzzzz. That's the sound of me snoring.The only thing worse than being bored at a film is being bored AND not giving a crap. And that's the case here. There's not a single character to care about. Oh sure there is a preponderance of cool effects, people hanging weightless in time and space and climbing on ceilings, but without a cohesive narrative or anyone to root for, they're just pretty images flashing on a big screen at a frenetic pace.Don't get me wrong, somewhere there is a good film here. Or at least there could have been. But as it stands it is a story not well told.Which is easier to explain: the plot of this film or the praise hefted upon it by critics and everyone else on this forum? Has Christopher Nolan risen to the level of Marty Scorsese and James Cameron where films are lauded despite whatever self-indulgent, effects-laden dreck they put on the screen?All throughout Inception I wanted to shoot myself so that I could wake up from this bad movie.

161,188,0.056898635,0.3882742,0.5548272,10,Proof That Classics Are Still Being Made Today.,"Once in a while, a film comes along that not only takes the cinematic world by storm, but also rewrites the rules of movie making altogether. Christopher Nolan's latest project, Inception, is one such achievement. Nolan had previously directed the masterpiece, The Dark Knight. That film gave us a whole new look into what a Batman film could be like. But with Inception, he creates something so new; so fresh and original that you wonder if even he fully understood it.Inception is a film about dreams. Dreams are complex, surreal, and full of mystery; all traits that this film also exhibits. In Inception, Leonardo DiCaprio plays an agent who penetrates people's dreams. He is after their secrets, and the dream state is when people have their mental guard down the most. The problem is that anything can happen in a dream. We've all had dreams so we know this. This movie introduces the notion of what it would be like if other people were actually allowed in our dreams. Using the best special effects available, the production team has done their absolute best to portray dreams in a way that makes sense to the viewer, but still comes off as fantastic and incredible.I should warn you: the plot is not easy to follow. One critic who reviewed the movie wondered if it was too smart for general audiences to grasp. Personally, I found that regardless of how complex the storyline got, it pulled off the miracle of not seeming overwrought or unmanageable. This is clearly the trait of a director who has mastered his craft. However, a captain is only as good as his crew. The cast of this film seemed quite committed to the job at hand, and much of the supporting cast (which includes such talented actors and actresses as Ellen Page, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Michael Caine, and Marion Cotillard) did just as great a job as DiCaprio. All this just goes to show how every little detail was treated with equal care and how flawless the whole production is.Some film buffs will argue that classics ceased to to be made years ago. I certainly don't agree with them, and this film is my proof. It also proves that even the biggest summer blockbusters can be intelligent and artistic. If The Dark Knight was the revolution, than Inception is the reign established afterward."

Now most people who I've told my opinion have accused me of being ""simple"" and ""not understanding it"". I believe I understood the movie very well, I appreciate Nolan's original idea and effort. It's just a shame that this idea is a piece of garbage. I enjoy intelligent movies, but there is nothing intelligent or even remotely exciting about people going into dreams, and then into dreams, and then into dreams again. The whole idea is simply ridiculous, and when Leonardo and Ariadne are in a dream together and Ariadne starts moving a huge glass door around - what on earth? Moving on to Leonardo, I cannot understand how such a poor, boring and depressive actor gets so much fame. I'm assuming this is all because of Titanic, but his role in Inception is shockingly boring and bad. And am I the only one who seems to see a pattern in Leo's movies (in both Inception and Shutter Island Leonardo's wife is dead, but he seems to think that she isn't)? Anyway, out of all the cast only Tom Hardy playing Eames is remotely likable. After seeing Cilian Murphy in some other brilliant roles (e.g. 28 Days Later) I was extremely disappointed while watching him become more miserable with every second in Inception. Leonardo's sidekick Arthur is plain annoying. I wish there had been more action in this movie other than in the scene in the snowy place. Aside from that, Inception is just a lot of talking about complete nonsense and lots of views of Leonardo's scared, confused face. Christopher Nolan made this movie way too ""intelligent"". The end result is tragic. One of the most overrated movies ever."

Inception is nothing more then Shutter Island meets the Matrix. The motive and the plot are the same in both Shutter Island and Inception. SPOILER DO NOT READ IF YOU WANT TO SEE THIS MOVIE.Both of DiCaprio's characters in these films both blame them selves for the death of their wives, they spend the movie creating a world where they do not have to live with the guilt of their loss. I know you are reading this and thinking ""But a lot of movies have wives as the root of the characters problems"" and your right so let me go further. In both movies DiCaprio also has issues with his children, in one they are dead and in the other he is unable to see them.Now if that isn't enough here is the mini cherry on top of the regular cherry on top of the Sunday of recycled garbage that is this film. In both movies he blames a single selfish action of his own doing for the reason of his wife's death. This is why he creates these worlds to live in to hide the truth from him self.On a positive note the effects of this movie were awesome. Some of the best I have seen in a long time I enjoy seeing Hollywood try something new rather then overload their films with CGI. Other than that I have nothing positive to say about this film.I end this by saying watch either Shutter Island or Inception, either film on their own was OK but when you watch one after the other all you can do is think ""Man why is Leo playing the same roll again, he has depth he is much better then this"". Also Nolan go out and find a good script and stop piggy backing off of other films."

The actors were uniformly dull, and no one stood out. The story line was well, just forget it, its not worth going into.""Memento"" by the same director is far superior to this mess. This movie isn't even in the same league as that. Also, the movie was too long, I was praying for it to end several times but it just kept going. It was a relief when the movie finally ended. I can't stand movies that wear out their welcome, and this movie should have been cut to 90 minutes.I'll give it a 5 just because it was an intelligent movie, but that is about all it had going for it."

Inception is one of those films - beyond breathtaking, an incredible mind-bending tale full of action and suspense which takes us in to the world of dreams and back.Inception is not only the most intelligent film of the year, it makes the rest look like a finger painting. Christopher Nolan has again manufactured a masterpiece of cinema, the story beyond intricate and full of psychological twists and turns through the mind of dreams which turns the action on its head - sometimes quite literally. The acting is exceptional, with Joseph Gordeon-Levitt standing out and proving again that he has more than enough acting chops to tackle bigger and better roles. What is really incredible is how Nolan manages to carry such an epic film with such a huge scale and yet maintain strong, well-rounded characters. Leonardo DiCaprio's Cobb is at the center of the story and the focus is never taken off of him. Through Leo's performance and through sitting in Cobb's dreams, Inception manages a new way of getting us to feel what the film's characters feel.Hans Zimmer's score perfectly compliments Nolan's actions on screen to create an experience films rarely give us anymore. Both epic and serene, Zimmer adds to the dream-like quality of the film and makes the action set pieces that much larger.The set pieces of Inception are amazing. Not only is it refreshing to see so many special effects without the use of CGI, but the implementation of these special effects are the best I've seen. I only wish I hadn't seen any trailers for this film, as going in to this movie with a blank pallet would have given the movie even more exceptional moments, instead of hoping or waiting for ""that moment"" or smiling when a humorous line from the trailer showed up in the film. I could talk about the one central fight scene of the film for hours, which is nothing short of a benchmark of set design, camera-work and cinematography. I could watch this scene on loop for hours just to be knocked out over and over again by the sheer scale of it.I cannot describe Inception as anything short of a masterpiece. Especially in the dredge of summer cinema, Inception reminds us why we go to films in the first place, giving us an intelligent film which doesn't fly over our heads (not that I'd recommend stepping out of the theater for ever a minute during the movie)."

Over and out.,"Having seen this 24 hours ago the more I think about it the more I think this is over-hyped and actually a rather poor movie. On leaving the cinema I was prepared to give it a 7 (well short of it's 9.3 on IMDb) but on reflection I'm downgrading it to a 5.5.Why? For a start the writing is ridiculously weak. The plot, although slightly intriguing in that you do make the effort to keep up with the triple (or is it quadruple) levels of depth, is preposterous. In short it's about a dream within a dream within a dream. I think that's correct! But, that said, who cares? It might be crafty but it isn't crafted. It's self indulgent in the extreme.Whilst not gratuitously violent, there are a lot of killings in this film, but the ""goodies"" are dead eye dicks to a man (and woman) whilst the ""baddies"" are way, way beyond inept. With five targets and two and a half hours of incessant shooting I counted only 2 direct hits, whereas the ""baddies"" must have taken in excess of 200 fatalities. Just plain silly really.Then there's the casting. Di Caprio is starting to look desperate for a decent acting part and Ellen Page absolutely sucks compared to her magnificent role in Juno (it's the writing I tell ya).The special effects are at times good, on one or two occasions I'd call them remarkable, but not on many. As an emotional engagement exercise it has all the impact of a potato. I've been more moved by a night in watching Blomberg TV.Christopher Nolan is just not that great a director or writer on this occasion.Sorry folks.(His mind was the scene of a crime.)"

'Inception' grabs your attention from the very start, and as mentioned before, leaves you awe-struck. And yes, 'Inception' packs in THE Best Climax Ever! It's simply astounding!!Nolan makes his careers best film in 'Inception'. His screenplay is EPIC, and his direction should land him an Academy-Award for Best Director! Wally Pfister's cinematography is sure to compliment him with numerous awards in the coming time. Music by Hans Zimmer, as always, is perfect.Each and Every Actor excels over-here: Leonardo DiCaprio takes the lead and steals the show. The star-actor becomes Dom Cobb, and delivers a memorable performance. Ellen Page is fantastic. Marion Cotillard is magnificent. Michael Caine, in a brief role, is flawless. Tom Hardy is very good, this is his best performance to date. Joseph Gordon-Levitt gets a role of a lifetime, and he sinks his teeth into it. Ken Watanabe is stylish, while Cillian Murphy is highly efficient. Tom Berenger is perfect. Dileep Rao is good.On the whole, Nolan's 'Inception' is worth your time and money.

Like nearly 99% of what has come out of Hollywood in the past 15 years or so, this film has loads of technique but little heart. It offers little to care for, and therefore little to remember.Yes, there's some fancy graphics, but that's about it. The internal logic of the nested dreams is routinely disrupted, the action sequences don't make much sense (why all the shooting, really?) and none of the characters are emotionally involving. Di Caprio's character has a nominal story arc at best, and the angst he's supposed to feel is not grounded because we don't know neither his nor his wife's history, or how they got together.Yes, Inception is a fun mind game. But like most mind games, it ultimately doesn't make for a worthwhile experience. And at 2.5 hours this mind game is far too overblown. Its lack of proportion (too much talk, too many levels, too much trivial action, complicated for the sake of complicated) unfortunately makes things worse. The incessant music, typical of Zimmer, is trivially repetitive, as are much of the action sequences. Ultimately these become much more intrusive and annoying as the film progressives.When I compare this film to older ones, like The Woman in the Window, which achieves so much more of a memorable experience and story, yet with so little, one has to wonder if technology and truckloads of cash are getting in the way of memorable storytelling.This film would have fared much better as a comedy, or maybe as round-table discussion about dreams, or maybe as a survey of a Facebook clique of friends sharing dreams. But the film needed to have far more fantasy to really evoke the sensation of dreamscapes. And most importantly, it needed a far more soulful and compelling story with characters we are allowed to learn about and therefore care about."

Any Director worth his salt should be able to really put on something special and I was expecting something spectacular from Christopher Nolan.Calling Inception an anti-climax would be an understatement. It was an utter and complete let-down. The special effects looked more suited to a music video, the character development was non-existent, the plot was simple and one-dimensional and once the movie ended the only thing that I was struggling to figure out was how on earth could so many people be so gullible.What a missed opportunity.If you're really looking for something mind bending that deals with dream states, dream manipulation and altered states of consciousness, try watching the superb 2009 6 part mini-series 'The Prisoner'."

On a fraction of the budget of this film,and zero CGI, he succeeds in being way more unsettling and detached from reality than any other director, and captures the vocabulary of dreaming authentically. Nolan is NOT a genius: The Dark Night was merely OK, and he dragged Gotham City into the gutter of a run - down Detroit, not the fantastical Gothic structures it should be. Memento was more interesting, though.When I saw the trailer I thought: ""Oh God, not Leo again. "" Or is it Neo? And the collapsing and spontaneously forming cityscapes are straight out of Dark City. Dark City was a Noir/Sci- Fi hybrid, too, made a long time before this. Doesn't have the awe-factor of,say 2001, or even Blade Runner.Not original, not brilliant, not lasting.It's true, what another reviewer said. This film is definitely age-indexed. The younger you are, the more impressed you'll be. The older you are, you might nod off, perchance to dream...."
175,204,0.083870925,0.4183447,0.49778438,6,Refreshing concept. Stale action,"Inception is overall an enjoyable experience. The concepts and rules Nolan presents to us are, like the intriguing Morpheus / Neo relationship (in the superior The Matrix) delivered to us in large chunks of exposition that never get boring due to the interesting ideas being put forth. This film never bores.However for a film about dreams, the action and set-pieces (except for a fight in zero G) are surprisingly unimaginative. Chases are never more than run, shoot, run (unlike some set pieces in the Bourne movies for example) and scenes like the ski chases in the snow feel flat when they could have been exciting set pieces with a bit more thought. It seems to me, that even though I enjoy his films, Nolan's weakest link is his direction of action.I also thought there could have been more use of the surreal and of the bending of physics at some stages. Yes I know they need the subject to be tricked into believing that it is not a dream but at one point a subject is told that he is dreaming, giving Nolan a pass to screw things up a bit visually. Yet he only goes so far as to have a bar shake and drinks in glasses bend with gravity. He could have gone further in scenes like this that's just my opinion.Overall this is worth seeing.

It keeps you engaged throughout and I think (?) you're routing for the right people, although in reality the overarching reason to undergo the entire film is a little weak, possibly skimmed over, and purely a vehicle to discover the world of dreams.Visually it cannot be faulted, and the pairing with the music works excellently as well. You're constantly drawn into the film without it ever being something that will get your heart racing, more interesting than compelling.

I'm not sure how people can dream together and have any kind of dream harmony, or effect any outcome on others. None of it makes any sense, and it's just a skeleton on which to hang crappy computer generated images; those beach scenes are especially cartoon-ish and pathetic.

It does have some good performances and... nope, that's it.It's not a terrible film, it's just very very dull. When all rules are taken away, it would be nice to see some genuine imagination - not a few FX set-pieces which don't, even at a most basic level, do anything to help the wafer-thin story, You know what this is like?

Too much of the criticism aimed at this film focuses on what it is not, which is a drama with complex characters. No, it doesn't flesh out any character besides DiCaprio's (and even his backstory seems to work more as plot than as an emotional core), but instead relies on its stars' personalities to quickly establish who they are without deeply exploring them. What the film is is a sci-fi thriller with elements of a heist picture, and it excels at what it does. Leonardo DiCaprio, along with partner Joseph Gordon-Levitt, play a couple of ""thieves"" who specialize in stealing corporate secrets from their victims' dreams. One of their victims, Ken Watanabe, comes back to hire them to invade a competitor's dreams and implant an idea (a process known as inception, a concept many in the dream-invading field think is not possible, though DiCaprio knows it is). This introduces the heist element, where DiCaprio and Gordon-Levitt go around the world recruiting the best specialists to help them perform this difficult task (this is where Ellen Page, Tom Hardy and Dileep Rao come in). The six of them (including Watanabe) then set out to invade Cillian Murphy's dreams, which they can only do at the third level down (i.e., the dream within a dream within a dream). At this point, the film becomes sort of a maze with the group of characters dealing with four different levels of the dreamworld, each of which works on a different timescale. They discover Murphy has been trained to combat dream invaders (apparently a pretty well known threat in the movie's world), which takes the form of tons of faceless thugs coming after the dream team in each level of dream. Also threatening their mission is Marion Cotillard, a dream ghost from DiCaprio's past who always threatens to wreck his mind invasions. It seems more complicated than it is at first, but Nolan does a great job (despite occasionally relying too much on expository dialog) explaining how it all works. The film itself isn't exactly ""deep"", but it's an intriguing and gripping experience. It's a rare experience to have this much fun in the theater. I think it only happens a few times in a decade."

The plot was immensely difficult to follow. I remember reading one of a free cinema magazines while watching it at the cinema. The plot is in a dream, that is in another dream that is in a dream while he is dreaming, or something along those lines. For the first half an hour or so I was engaged with the film's plot. Who wouldn't be interested in the idea that Nolan was playing with? But he took his ideas too far in the case of 'Inception.' The whole thing just became ridiculous. The bizarre plot had an effect on the other aspects of the film. The otherwise brilliant action scenes became surprisingly dull. As I often had little idea of what was going on, to me the action scenes just seemed pointless as I did not know what the characters motives were.Despite this, the action scenes and the cinematography did offer a real spectacle.Again, one of the positives was that the acting was, admittedly of a good quality. DiCaprio, Page, Caine and Postlewaite all had good performances. But is was such a shame that I was not able to follow the development of the characters because of the plot.Overall, if you enjoy a mind-boggling plot then 'Inception' will be for you. If you want a film that you will enjoy from start to finish without having to get into it, 'Inception' will not be for you."

That about sums it all up.The movie writes it's own rule book regarding dreams and assumes that time moves exponentially more slowly when you dream within dreams. There is no evidence for this as fact and my experience and understanding is that dreams can go both ways - sometimes an epic takes minutes and others an action takes hours.So having said that the whole conceptual context falls apart and crumbles into absurdity. And why would movement in a dream affect a dream within a dream as occurs in this movie? When you dream you leave the real world behind - until you awaken.This movie has been compared with the Matrix trilogy. Well it blatantly rips it off but that's another dream - or rather a fantasy. This movie doesn't even come close to Matrix which was truly original and at a stretch even plausible. This isn't.

First of all the acting - Keanu Reeves and Joseph Gordon-Levitt - separated at birth, and neither can act at all. I liked Ellen Page very much in Juno, but she was sadly miscast in this role. Not that any actress could have made sense out of her character - she was at random times a newbie, who needed the basics explained, and/or an authority on how the whole thing worked. The plot was filled with these messy holes, but it wasn't entirely negative - some of the effects were fun, and DiCaprio is always good, as was most of his supporting cast.

First of all, the story takes forever to get going. The slow pace at the beginning of the film is nauseating. And there is no explaining of what exactly they put on their arms? Or did I douse off during that? The drastic, loud music is there to make the movie more suspenseful than it really is. Which I kindly had to explain to my girl friend. If the music wasn't there, you really wouldn't have thought it was that suspenseful/thrilling. People have compared this to Matrix. Right, I sort of get that. But the Matrix was SO ground breaking! The Matrix made you love Neo and the action was supposed to be in the film. Inception the action feels forced. This isn't a thriller it was an Action Film. Mindless dribble talked about felt as if they were mumbling -- once you get that you get a bunch of characters you don't care about. Leo crying about his family AGAIN?! How many movies can I take with him crying about his family?All the action in the film and the different scenery reminded me much more of a James Bond film than anything. Go from the City, to the Snowy White Mountains to The Beach. I was just waiting for James Bond to come in on a silver coupe BMW and say, ""Bond, James Bond."" Sure you don't ever want to compare films to other movies. But look at Shutter Island and compare it to this. A lot of people didn't like Shutter Island, and those same people LOVE Inception.

For those who are looking for something simple, something plain, and something that won't require a grand extent of their brain power, they will get bored with ""Inception"". This is an adult film in the regard that it requires your full attention, and your brain must be plugged into it, or you are going to miss it ALL OF IT.I believe that this film definitely deserves a place for the ""Best Picture"" nomination at the Oscars this year, along with more recognition to Nolan as a director and a writer, for he has made the most original film I have probably seen in a very long time.

The movie gets four stars from me primarily because the CGI is not as bad as most other recent movies and Leo actually does some decent work. (Gordon-Levitt is also quite good, but he's canceled out by Ellen Page, who is, as usual, barely tolerable and not at all believable in her role.) Frankly, I just don't get the hype over ""Inception"" as metaphor, and it sure doesn't impress me as being a truly deep or complex movie. It's more like the level of the well-known character explaining how our solar system could actually itself be an atom, with the sun as the nucleus, etc.Actually, I take that back...it IS a complex movie. Needlessly complex, I might add. The whole set of rules for entering into (and out of) someone's dreams are so ridiculously complex that they obviously exist only to set up the action sequences. Unfortunately, this makes it necessary for all the characters to explain them to each other throughout most of the movie. (Why is this? If they're professionals at doing this sort of thing, why do they all need to have it explained to them each time? That's like reminding a soldier how to take the safety off his weapon just before exiting the personnel carrier.) Furthermore, the dream world is not dream-like. It's more like the virtual world of ""Tron."" If I were shown the action sequences with no exposition, I'd guess that the characters were in a virtual world, or in another dimension, but not in a dream.Finally, in spite of some good performances, I didn't give a lickspittle about the characters. What they are doing (or attempting to do) is immoral and unethical. And what risks they face are basically virtual as well. Who gives a flip? There's no redemption, no character development, no introspection (at any substantive level), and what you're left with is a mixture of pop psychology and ""the solar system itself may just be an atom.""

You feel like you know each and every one of them, the suspense was awful (but in the best way possible). If I had to put the title of 'prefect' on any film, Inception would be it. It is literally flawless.I have never seen a movie that actually made me sit on the edge of my seat sweating and sipping on my Coke like a nervous wreck. I have never seen a movie where I literally wanted to jump into the screen and save one of the characters, I have never seen a movie that could make me want to cry one second, shout out in anger the next, and rejoice the next. That was the power of Inception.To say that this movie was good, or even great is a enormous understatement. This move was without a doubt the best movie I have ever seen in a cinema.

I'm only doing this to justify myself about the 2 star rating. I would normally have rated this movie with 6 points. But as other reviewers state, I feel that is just fair to give a lower rate to balance a little the totally overblown rate it has. This film looks fantastic in Blu-Ray. There are several sequences that are a real visual delight (the Paris café scene where Di Caprio's character is explaining the young dream architect portrayed by Ellen Page and the 0 gravity sequence in the second layer dream). But the problem is that beyond that you don't have much. Looks like Mr. Nolan sacrificed plot line and character developed for the technical aspects. The plot is not complex, is just convoluted. The characters are cardboard thin and underdeveloped. I never imagined dreams could be as uninteresting as in this movie. Have you ever watched Fellini's movies? Or Tartovsky's? or Cocteau's? or Buñuel's? Plenty of dream-like images there  One last word: it's a pity to gather such fine actors and waste them as Mr. Nolan did here; Joseph Gordon Levitt, Cillian Murphy and Watanabe san do what they can with the script, but Leonardo DiCaprio can't do much to give some life to his character.

I was mostly irritated about all the shooting and action since it did nothing but prolong the movie. In the end the movie has an interesting concept that gets mixed in with James Bond and all other action movies you can think of and it just feels like a total waste of time to go see this film. It is neither a good action movie nor a movie with a believable story. The movie just is not interesting and it does not feel unique.Go see something else!"

Disappointing.,"This movie is about dreams in a sense that the main characters have the ability to dream on demand, and enter other peoples' dreams. I have always been fascinated by dreams; the difference in the perception of time in dream space; the effects of the physical changes occurring in the dreamer's reality to the events in his or her dream. I was excited towards the beginning of the film where the main characters are shown to explore and build dream worlds. The plot which follows is too complicated to be enjoyed. It is a pretty good plot with very few loose ends, but I felt that the filmmakers could have made a more fantastic a more rich experience when it comes to the dream worlds shown in the film. I would rate Shutter Island, which is similar in the sense that it deals with the imaginative powers of the mind and its effects, a lot higher. Or a film like Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, where thoughts and memories and the wanderings of the mind are depicted in so touching a manner. Inception has gunmen and hand grenade launchers, fast car chases and action...things which were not completely necessary for the plot to seem effective. I felt that the film could have made use of the creative license that dreams gives it, in a far more effective way. Also, Dreaming Is a Private Thing. Sharing dreams is a definite no no :). http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dreaming_Is_a_Private_Thing"

This is a fascinating, esoteric subject but like all fascinating subjects, when Hollywood gets a hold of it, look out! You may be in for a ride, to a place we know not where. A story works best when it has a beginning, a middle and and end. When you tamper with that structure, such as by starting a movie with a flashback, you're inviting confusion and frankly, who wants to go to the movies to be confused. Stories should be told straightforwardly, but that is not the case with this movie. Is Mr. DiCaprio in a dream or not? After a while, it becomes a moot point as the movie just keeps rambling on and on to its inevitable conclusion. Nevertheless, the movie does explore some interesting subjects such as idea formation, mind manipulation, the subconscious and mental activity during sleep. Where the movie stalls is in plausibility and structure. Yet, despite these drawbacks, the movie is worth watching because of Leonardo DiCaprio who once again gives an excellent performance as a stalwart yet troubled mind prober. He carries the movie which alone makes it watchable. Once again Hollywood has taken a perfectly good idea for a movie and has watered it down. Brainwashing is a fascinating subject. It is a key element in The Manchurian Candidate. How do we know that our ideas are actually ours and not planted into our heads? That is the underlying theme of this movie. The problem is, the story itself is so muddled and confusing that at times it becomes a distraction. Leonardi DiCaprio is excellent as a mind prober with emotional issues which get in the way of doing his job. The premise of the story is interesting , especially as it relates to questions of consciousness and unconsciousness and the formulation of ideas during sleep. But then the movie loses focus as the DiCaprio character gets more and more hung up on his emotional problems, thus diverting attention away from the movie's original premise. However, this is a good movie and is worth watching but with this disclaimer: it may put you to sleep."

In fact, telling anyone a thing not known from a trailer ... well I'd feel like a jerk. Inception is about technology that can invade peoples mind for numerous reasons. Christopher Nolan ( Writer and Director ) goes above and beyond exploring the process, exploring the mind, and exploring the concepts, possibilities, and well... dreams.Everyone praises James Cameron as the master of visual effects and whatnot. After seeing Inception I'm inclined to believe that from everything but a technical standpoint, James Cameron can only dream of making visual effects that come even close to evoking the type and magnitude of emotions that Inception can. Inception is absolutely awe-inspiring in scope. it's not a summer blockbuster thrill-ride, or an emotional roller-coaster, it's the absolute best aspects of both. The script and acting are all phenomenal. Dicaprio gives not an only an Oscar worthy performance but his best performance ever. it's not all about Dicaprio though as he is surrounded by an ensemble cast with names such as Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Cillian Murphy, and many more. More importantly, their performances too are incredible. The original score by Hans Zimmer is as usual outstanding and amplifies the intensity and emotion within every scene. With and outstanding creative and innovative plot that's massive in scope with substance and a number of eye popping visual effects that will be forever planted in your mind, amazing direction and acting, and an amazing score, there is no reason not to watch Inception. Yes the story is very complex but at the same time everything that's important is easy to grasp. 2 views isn't necessary but it's worth it. hell, 10 views are worth it.Chris Nolan is no longer chasing directors like Kubrick, Tarantino, or Scorcese. Chris Nolan is now #1. Between Memento, The Dark Knight, and Inception, Chris Nolan is the greatest director of our time, one of the best ever, and one of the most important directors ever.Inception is simply one of the best films ever made and one of about 5-10 movies i'd ever give an absolute perfect 10/10"

We have Ken Watanabe, Cilian Murphy, Marion Cotillard, Michael Caine, Tom Berenger, Pete Postlethwait, and in the lead, none other than Leonardo di Caprio. The director and writer Christopher Nolan also comes with a very impressive oeuvre behind him, with ""Memento,"" ""The Prestige,"" and most recently, ""The Dark Knight.""This film is one of the most complicated films I have seen. A fair summary is almost impossible to put into words. It is challenging to follow all the jumping into and out of dreams, in dreams within dreams. I won't be surprised if you do not completely understand everything that was going on by the end. However, the visual experience of being in this multi-layered dream world is unmatchable in any recent films.I thought of ""The Matrix,"" and even Leo's latest (excellent) work ""Shutter Island,"" as this film proceeds to disorient you about what is and is not reality. However, ""Inception"" goes several levels higher in the hierarchy of convolutions in film. There are at least four levels of simultaneous dream upon dream happening at one time at one point. Amazing film editing work!Then there are technical aspects which were mind-boggling indeed, as Nolan's bizarre script required. The audience is brought inside buildings, rooms, elevators, even entire cities where you lose the sense of space, time, gravity and logic. It is a dream world--you need to see it to fully appreciate what I just wrote. The musical score of Hans Zimmer was strong and dramatic. These are definitely contenders by Oscar time.This film is not for everyone. There are those who would dismiss this as impossibly pretentious and pointless. But for me, ""Inception"" was very stimulating and challenging -- a film well-worthy to spend two and a half hours of our valuable time. Be ready to face this challenge when you go watch it. I won't be surprised if you feel you need to watch it all over again."

You could make a compelling movie out of that.What do we get instead? A tedious action movie with Bond-level stunts (not a compliment) with two other major problems:1. A Matryoshka Dolls narrative that gets irritating after about the third iteration, never mind the 13th.2. Dialogue that is such pseudo-science gibberish it's hard to believe anybody over the age of 14 is falling for it.A few other points. The Juno chick can't act. Ken Watanabe can't speak understandable English. The soundtrack is a by-the-numbers Feel This Emotion Now tone cliche.In sum, this movie tired me out within 45 minutes and I've sat spellbound through the 5-hour French version of Les Miserables from 1934."

There is no reason or emotion in caring about characters that are chaff in a rather ordinary logician's game.Years ago Thomas Pynchon was considered an important writer, and the author and critic (and sometime film critic) Peter Ackroyd wrote an astute review of his major work, ""Gravity's Rainbow"", in which he ridiculed the ease of such writing; it's deceptive cleverness; it's egoism, and its immaturity because it is so overtly obvious, and like anything childish, of no real lasting interest artistically.

It was an interesting concept but just evolved into a plethora of violence, noise, and special effects. I am a Leanardo Decaprio fan and have been impressed with his acting since What's Eating Gilbert Grape? (1993) but there was very little acting in this movie, note: no Oscar nominations for acting in any category. I can't understand how it was nominated for Best Picture, other than the fact the needed to fill up the new number of 10 nominees needed. Note, no nomination for Best Director. I thought Ellen Page was hugely miscast; she was a distraction through-out the movie. There were only 2 or 3 brief scenes when there was a bit of meaningful dialogue. There was the potential to develop Cobb's relationship with Saito, but it never happened. If you are expecting a movie with good acting, good direction, and any depth, do not go to see Inception.

So I paid my $12 bucks and bought a ticket for Inception and walked in without knowing what to expect . I thought this film would be more of a psychological thriller but I was mistaken . I found myself trying to play catch-up with this confusing plot from start to finish . I remember seeing people floating around in zero gravity, machine guns blazing , bombs exploding , buildings collapsing , numerous car crashes , and lots and lots of chase scenes , fights, falls, and natural disasters . Just about everything you would expect to see in any big budget summer action flick . By the time this long movie ended I couldn't have cared less . As I exited the theater I looked at the faces of my fellow movie goers . No one commented on how good it was or how much it stunk .

So I guess I'm in the minority of unhappy of Inception reviewers .

Not just 'hacking' into someone's dreams but manipulating their thoughts inside Dreamworld. And then, to add to the confusion, we had dreams within dreams within dreams! If the complex plot had an internal logic which appeared not to defeat Leonardo DiCaprio - it certainly defeated me. There is considerable homage to the MATRIX films, with aerial fights and frozen motion sequences: kid's stuff, but what do kids make of the anarchic storyline? If you die in someone else's dream, you can either wake up alive or go to a place called Limbo (not the same as the one Dante envisaged) which looked like the flooded New York of The Day After Tomorrow a few decades on. The plus side of Limbo for Leo was that it reunited him with his dead wife (Marion Cotillard), but was this his limbo or hers? Best not to ask.If MEMENTO, with time running backwards, was Christopher Nolan's ""set text"" for Filmgoing GCSE, I guess INCEPTION represents A-Level movie comprehension.And I seem to have failed."

This one comes especially close to Poe's view that all that we see is but a dream within a dream. The premise used to question our grasp on reality is fairly original: a team of individuals with different specialties has the ability to enter and stage other people's dreams, extract information from their subconscious and, crucially, even implant ideas with the expectation that these will, so to speak, rise to the surface--an original method of suggestion. The film spends quite a bit of time acquainting the viewer with the main characters and the peculiar laws that govern their work before setting them on the mission the plot centers on. While it is not always easy to follow, I found this setup the most arresting part of the film. Unfortunately, the main narrative does not, in my view, live up to the promise of the setup. The film is laden with scenes that would fit into any of a legion of Hollywood action flicks: car chases, hand to hand combat, explosions, shoot-'em-ups. It cannot be said that all of these serve to advance the narrative; the rationale for proceeding from one hackneyed scene to the next is frequently contrived, illogical or murky. Technically, they are well done and should gratify those who thrive on such fare. Visually, I found the scenes that show the generation of dreamscapes most laudable: the effects truly dazzle. I won't say the film entirely neglects the story it sets in motion but I certainly feel the time devoted to car chases and explosions could have been profitably devoted to developing the story and characters. To give a glaring example, I would have liked to have known the aftermath of the heros' intervention in their target's subconscious."

Besides being accompanied by a score determined to set you to sleep there's really no filmmaking here that sets it above the rest.The plot is very interesting and, for the most part, well conceived. However, the characters do too much talking simply explaining to the audience what the meaning of their actions are. Why assume the audience is inept?The basis of the plot itself is where film most earns its grade. This is truly a unique idea for the screen. Unfortunately, it was denigrated by the unnecessary dumbing down of the story and the unimpressive acting of the cast.No matter what the subject of a movie, to end it with the question of whether it was all a dream or not is not clever."

I agree with some other reviewers on here, that this film passes itself off as being very intelligent and clever but only for people who don't have any intelligence and are easily pleased.I like Nolan's other work - Dark Knight was excellent, however, this movie is nowhere near as good and felt pretty lame.I think a lot of people who don't even understand this movie, just gave it a high rating assuming it was a clever movie when it actually wasn't that good at all.This movie is certainly 'not' a masterpiece or anything even close. It felt like a Matrix wannabe, but I have to say The Matrix blows this movie out of the water by a huge margin.As I write this review, this movie is currently in the top 3 movies of all time?? I've never been more shocked - get real people. It seems the film companies are paying people to vote on here and boost their films - there can be no other explanation.

There are so many plot holes in this movie that it really makes you wonder whether director even cared. I would not go into the details as the other reviewers have already pointed out but for me its a promise unfulfilled. I have always considered Christopher Nolan to be an amazing director but with this one he probably got confused himself or devised convenient ways to resolve plot twists. The movie does have some entertainment value but when you begin to think of the plot it leaves you with a feeling of having been cheated. I would have given it a 5 for its characters and decent graphics but the insipid linear plot line and and an undeserved rating on IMDb forces me to do my part and bring it the level where it should be.

I'm not a great movie fan, i don't really make a goal for myself in following some trend or idea in the movie world, let's just say I feel sometimes the TV set has too much control on the movies I watch, :), and coming from this I dare to say that the theme is not quite present in the past years, and this is a good thing to start with for a success movie. But besides being an original idea, i think it's followers failed to make the most out of it. My point is that if you try to extract from the movie the specific of this new world they discovered for us you can see it's not too much. You can bend the cityscape, you can make the things explode, there are new specializations for the people involved (some create and some just act), and somehow you can keep some dead people consciousness trapped inside this world, and there's a door to some dark other world where these dead people go. And this is all about this mind world. The bad thing is that this is not enough. It's not enough developed for us and it was not enough for this movie authors. Apart from this comes a load of pop-corn movie elements which you can see in every typical action movie: they run a lot, they shot each other a lot, and that's about all. So the specific of the mind world is left apart, and the action movie takes too much. In this sense I say it's a lost opportunity. Too bad for them - the movie industry - that they spoiled us with such great movies as ""Solaris"", ""Dark City"", ""Sin City"", ""Immortel"" and a lot more - some of my favourite movies ever - and learned us what to expect from such alternate reality worlds and ideas. This movies have fully developed worlds in which the original element or idea is led to take entirely over the world and action and it's doing it so good ! The action of such movies can't be the same outside these movies and in this sense we can say these movies ideas are fully grown and developed. And this is the major shortcoming of ""Inception"", it can be more, it's a lost opportunity to do a really great movie with a novel idea."

The movie wants to be too intelligent for its own good. I preferred how dreams where presented in ""Eternal Sunshine of a Spotless Mind"": blurry, not cohesive stories and unpredictable.Inception used dreamworlds as a cheap way of adding car chases, shoot outs in snow.

I couldn't emotionally engage with the characters for some reason, and so was not too concerned on the outcome for them.Whilst there were some complexities to the plot, it is reasonably easy to understand. I agree with some other comments I've seen that many characters accepted the quite fantastical premise very readily, and were prepared to place themselves at considerable risk for no real reason.

Since this is the first movie I've seen of his that isn't part of the Batman series (correction, I did see The Prestige and review it back in 2006), I just marvel at how creatively compelling his work truly is when he literally uses his imagination to the fullest of his ability. To make a more apt comparison: What ""Lost"" is to television, Inception is to the movies-the ability to truly take you to places you've never been before. Plus, what a great cast: Leonardo DiCaprio, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Ellen Page, Tom Hardy, Ken Watanabe, Dileep Rao, Cillian Murphy, Tom Berenger, Marion Cotillard, Pete Postlethwaite, and Michael Caine among others. All deserve the kudos they're getting and more. No wonder it's been No. 1 at the box office these past three weeks! This movie isn't very easy to describe so I won't even try.

Nolan's script fails in multiple areas that harm the film significantly.1. The characterization is mediocre. Most of the members of the team are one-note, shallow and uninteresting. This greatly hampers your emotional attachment to the film and prevents you from caring about the outcome. Compared to the intense and complex characters of The Prestige, Insomnia, and Memento, the cast of Inception appears to be mostly slick suits walking around and doing things.2. The grandiose themes and interesting concepts that existed in The Dark Knight or Batman Begins are nowhere to be found here. Terrorism, corruption, or duty are ignored for love (which is dealt with in some of the most trite dialogue ever).3. The plot is too twisty for it's own good, resulting in you appreciating it less as a film and more as a puzzle. Vaguity does not equal genius, contrary to many critic's beliefs.In conclusion, Inception is a visually stunning film with aspirations at being significant, but it fails. Is it a thoughtful blockbuster? Yes. Is it the worst film Nolan has ever made? Absolutely. Should you watch it? Yes."

OK, I am a huge Christopher Nolan fan and I love dark movies with great twists. I loved Memento..Prestige, I had to watch it twice to understand it.I have seen dreams inside dreams inside dreams, so I got the movie from the moment it started. I will not spoil it too much but everything in the movie are explained clearly. The mystery of the movie is inside the mind of Cobb. He is hiding his subconscious guilt and still playing the game of inception with his team members. This is the most difficult job he has to do and all the time he is haunted by his wife. The movie is understandable. Leonardo Dicaprio's one of the best performance after The Blood Diamond. Ellen Page is absolutely the character Nolan wanted from her. She is a brilliant architect and also curious about all the mysteries that goes around Cobb's life. This is the first movie I have seen of Joseph Gordon-Levitt.

But from re-watching them a bunch over the years, I do feel that Inception hits the hardest, even though Interstellar and The Dark Knight have their own weighty effect different from Inception.I watch movies for the magic and emotion, and even though The Dark Knight is technically excellent and brilliantly acted, the strengths of Inception edge it out slightly I think.I love the cast of Inception; especially the incredible performances of Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Cillian Murphy, Marion Cotillard, and Ellen Page.Those four actors in this movie are pure magic, especially accented with Leo DiCaprio, Tom Hardy and Ken Watanabe, along with everyone else.The holy trinity of Nolan in my mind at least, are Inception, Interstellar, and The Dark Knight, with The Prestige and Memento not far behind.I can't wait to see Nolan make an even greater magnum opus, one to dethrone Shawshank Redemption from its imdb number 1 spot.

The characters in this movie have no personality or depth. Worse, because you cannot sympathise with them in any way, they add a clichéd sob story for the main character, to fill the gap left by a clinical inability to project any humanity onto him, through the use of dialogue. Score = 1/10. The acting is OK. Average. But with no characters to act, I would imagine this isn't hard. Score = 3/10. The plot is complicated (for a movie), fast paced and based on the most spurious, simplistic and quasi-scientific description of the human mind. It demands that you concentrate to keep up, so it is very disappointing to realise that your efforts are unrewarded. There are logical, philosophical, scientific and psychological flaws with every turn of the plot, and it isn't even consistent in these. This makes it a very boring movie to watch so a big fat 1/10 for plot. Production is good. Nice special effects with a big budget. 7/10. So far we have 12/40, which is 3/10. This means I would have to give -7/10 for x-factor, in order to arrive at a final score of 1/10, which is what this movie deserves, because it claims to be so much that it is not.

It did not captivate me as much. For a story about dreams, there's nothing in the movie that felt dream-like or creative to me. It felt mechanical and laborious.I did not understand the responsibility and work the architect has to do. There were no perplexing mazes in the dreams that I had hoped to see. The character Ellen Page played was only a plot device to lead us into Dicaprio's unresolved issues with the past, nothing more.Maybe I am not intelligent enough to fully appreciate this movie sure, just as I don't understand some reviewers with their difficult choice of expressions.

We agreed that it was one of the WORST films we have ever seen in our lifetimes.Yes - we did GET the gist of the convoluted plot, but the dialog and visuals were at times laughable and silly as Christopher Nolan force-fed the audience with course after course of nonsensical explanations of how dreams work, their layers, and the non-specific techniques the poorly defined characters would use for ""extraction"" and their ""inception"" caper.I felt zero attachment to any of the characters in the story and didn't much care about their fate. If you've seen the trailer you've seen ALL of the cool special effects nearly in their entirety. The much-ballyhooed scenes that involve floating people were just ripped-off variations of similar scenes from The Matrix series.The only explanation I have for the popularity of Inception is my theory that more than 70% of theater audiences fell asleep during the first 10 minutes and dreamed that they saw a good film.If you want to experience excitement in dreams, just lay down and take a nap.

As for the performances, DiCaprio came off as being slightly miscast, it seemed to me that he had to work a little too hard to get his lines out. It felt like Page, whom I do adore, was thrown in at the last minute for some token estrogen. I do always love to see Caine in small but meaty roles, this one was small but hardly meaty.

The absolute adulation it's getting is--and an overall number 3 on Top 250 IMDb.com--just inSANE! I think this is just a LOT of people wanting to be seen as cool and hip. But really folks...I enjoyed ""Toy Story 3"" more. I must give the weightlessness special effect special mention along with a fight scene with shifting gravity. Nicely done...All-in-all, there are worse ways to spend 2.5 hours...listening to an Obama speech, for example...See it soon if you want to be the first one on your block, but keep your expectations within reason and you won't be terribly disappointed."

Second it relies too much on frenetic activity to cover up its more grievous shortfalls. And third it's not really sci-fi, it's more a psychological thriller. But despite all that it is what it is portraying, an attempt to implant a notion, and that's highly commendable on several levels. Also a few of the scenes are both memorable and essentially flawless.The acting's all there too despite what some critics claim. DiCaprio is capable and fully invested. Joseph Gordon-Levitt's performance is especially engaging, but the casting of Ellen Page was a near fatal mistake if you ask me. I can see why she made sense to the director and producers, but she's a drag on the movie as is Ken Watanabe who I could barely understand half the time. Still I like his acting and I can tolerate his pronunciation here. Page I don't like for some reason. Perhaps it's just too distracting and/or annoying to see her exude an almost pre-adolescent lack of experience again. If they needed an 'innocent', and I don't really agree, I would have preferred Dakota Fanning. Marion Cotillard does the exact opposite, she's worldly and knowing, but her I'd like to protect and get to know personally.I would have liked to see a slower more moody treatment of this topic. Though at least one of the chase scenes is masterful and hair-raising, the real pay dirt would have been imagining trying to enter another person's mind. In fact the separation between our minds is the bedrock on which most of our problems lay. A 'shared dream' as portrayed here would have been several notches more paradigm breaking than depicted here, I think, and that's no small flaw in this film."

I'm not a fan of science fiction movies, specially ones with strange creatures. What makes me to like Inception this much is the fact that it picks one real thing, something we encounter every day, our dreams, and takes us to the unknown world of dreaming.

Or what seemed like bad writing, directing, acting etc., was actually outstanding. It's like an engineer telling us when we complain about a p.o.s. technical gadget we just bought not working the way it's supposed to that it is actually quite easy to use: ""Here let me show you.

You would be much better off watching a film like Videodrome or the animated film Mindgame if you want to truly be thrown sideways. This one is about as deep as Total Recall, but takes itself about ten times as seriously.I gave this a one merely as a corrective to the ridiculously high score that only a team of studio clerks working round the clock could have pushed to such a level.

After Mulholland Drive, I spent hours on the Internet, and then I had to watch it again. A great film but man was I lost.I'm sure this sounds funny to many young IMBb members, who see this kind of film all the time, but this Casablanca fan gets confused easily. For that, I thank writer/director Christopher Nolan, whose scripts for ""The Prestige,"" ""Memento,"" and ""Batman Begins,"" I absolutely loved. He's really a favorite.Another favorite of mine is the ever-boyish Leonardo DiCaprio, who is a wonderful actor and gives a great performance in his role, ably supported by the always excellent Marion Cotillard, Cillian Murphy (a new favorite), and the rest of the cast.Someone somewhere who hated this movie said that anyone who thought Nolan was trying to say something serious is crazy. I don't know if he was or not, but I think the whole subject of the subconscious and the dream state and creating a reality are intriguing topics. Many do question is our whole reality on earth is a dream. Not sure ""Inception"" really answers that, but it's an absorbing film."

Come on, I was on the edge of my seat when I was watching The Matrix going WOW several times and I was never disappointed and what a simple yet powerful message this was! With Inception I felt like watching The Prison Break series episode 10050. The movie provides absolutely no answers why I should bother to worry if they deliver the thought to the poor sob's head which they drugged on the plane. I simply don't care if they succeed or not.

And that was because Nolan is one the few directors in Hollywood able to create something truly original and as such should not be adding branches to fully grown trees.""Inception"" proves the validity of my claim, but it does so in ways that surprised me.Perhaps the most immediate distinction between ""Inception"" and the ""Dark Knight"" is an improved sense of pacing. It doesn't feel like narrative put in a blender like the batman movie did: despite its scope, each scene is warranted plenty of time and the use of more traditional associative cuts allow it to flow better.The movie itself is difficult to describe,which is a non-issue because it requires itself to be experienced to be understood.Another area Nolan seems to be grasping is in directing actors: I always liked Leonardo DiCaprio, but his mannerisms at times can be the thing obstructing a good actor from becoming great. In ""Inception"", all his mannerisms are gone and this is finest performance ever.The special effects are incredibly well done, which means they don't look like CGI, even when they are. However, one of its greatest technical achievements is the sound editing, perfectly balancing the several momentums of the scenes.Wishing to provide no spoilers at all, I'll just say it isn't nearly as complicated as some have named it, but it is a complex concept.I cannot compliment this movie enough.

Its something one has never imagined of. The whole movie was so exciting and blink-and-you-will-miss type that you will have to see it again or rethink it again and again to grasp the total plot, just like 'Memento'. I was always fond of Nolan's movie background sounds as it keeps you at the edge of your seat.Now comes the acting part. Caprio was excellent, well accompanied by Joseph Gordon Levitt and Ellen Page and others. But I would rather say that the actors didn't got much chance to do anything. They did exactly what the script demanded.The direction was top notch along with the breathtaking visuals and locations. Especially the dream scenes. As for the academy awards, I expect this film to grab the prize in direction,screenplay,sound mixing,sound editing and visual effects and may also the best picture(not quite sure after watching Toy Story 3 few weeks back).Anyway, for the people who are reading this review before going to see it, I would advise that, this would blow your mind.

This film is much like 'The Matrix Reloaded', all concept and no real climax or conclusion. Unlike The Matrix Reloaded, we don't already know there is going to be a sequel coming next summer. Leonardo DiCaprio is having the same issues we've already seen him deal with earlier this year in Scorsese's' brilliant 'Shutter Island'. It's Joseph Gordon-Levitt's character who is too cool and I would have liked to seen more of. Ellen Page is great and the best scenes where with her, I really would have liked to have followed her character around more, as she learns how to be a 'dream architect.'We get glimpses of awesomeness but there are too many things going on, all at once, for us as an audience, to put our emotions into. It's impossible to find yourself on the edge of your seat when a film has this much going on!'Inception' build and builds, introducing new concepts and ideas for so long that by the time the action begins, minds are already invested in trying to figure out how 'Inception' works instead of being fuelled with adrenaline to cheer on their favourite characters. Our minds are set on getting to the conclusion so we can figure everything out but the action sequences seem to never cease and we are torn between a deeply intense psychological thriller and a James Bond-like action flick.The people in the theatre with me did not leave happy or satisfied. They were tired, burnt-out and confused as hell. This is defiantly a movie strictly for Christopher Nolan's fans and lovers of 'The Matrix' sequels.The ideas are great but there are enough concepts here to make 3 films.

While he was making Inception Christopher Nolan needed more funding therefore he decided to make the Dark Knight. Sadly Heath Ledger passed away but his death brought more fame and fortune than Nolan expected. He was planning on reusing ALL actors in the Dark Knight but Christian Baile went on a drama-queen rampage on set against the lighting director causing Nolan to lean towards DiCaprio as his lead. (This came about because Nolan happened to be sipping tea with Scorsese one lovely evening, discussing Shutter Island and how fantastically adorable DiCaprio was in thrillers.) The Dark Knight was at best a side project because what Director Christopher Nolan REALLY had in mind was to F*** with our sense of reality through HIS thriller, Inception.No movie has ever caused me physical pain except this one. i was cringing from suspense. Every muscle in my body ached. my lungs were collapsed and when i tried to stand up after the credits i just couldn't. i just could not BREATHE. my eyes still sting. why? because the entire movie, my eyes were GLUED to the screen and i probably blinked, oh lets say, ZERO times. driving back from the theater, i lost my voice raving about the movie with my friends. and Hans Zimmer? i made my own Hollywood Star for him in the backyard. the grass spell out his name. i loved this movie.

However, to condemn this movie as a Hollywood CGI polished ripoff of Paprika is preposterous. Inception stands on his own because it has an entirely different plot and characters.The best thing about this movie are the settings, with a ton of dream within a dream within a dream worlds, for me at least Nolan successfully presents us with a fairly coherent state of one's dream (coherent enough to be filmed with CGI at least) without losing the glorious incomprehensibleness of dream itself. However, sadly all of the best CGIs and dream worlds stuffs here on this movie has been spoiled in the trailer, the folding city, the zero gravity hotel room and the icy fortresses.The acting quality of what could be considered the best all-star casts in any 2010 movie complements the set and plot nicely without any particular character chewing the scenery. However, somewhat annoyingly in my opinion DiCaprio's acting falls short and feels a little bit dull compared to the sheer awesomeness of the environment. His character seems distracted and somewhat bored throughout the movie. His inner struggle projected in the dream settings throughout the movie in my opinion totally distracts the flow of the plot and completely unnecessary since we have already seen DiCaprio struggles against his own mental projection and questioning reality in another movie. Shutter ** cough.. cough.. Now that I've written three paragraphs about this movie, I felt that I'm somehow being to harsh. This is a really good movie, for me it holds a respectable second best movie in 2010 after Toy Story 3 and definitely a top 10 movie in this decade. The action is really intense and the dream worlds presented by Nolan are really top notch. Although the sub-plot DiCaprio's mental stuff kinda drags a little bit, it doesn't decrease the sheer volatile awesomeness of this movie."

I'm gonna keep this short and say that Inception did not give me that sense of wonder. Inception is an average Hollywood action sci-fi with nicely rendered CGI and famous actors who neither amaze nor disappoint. If this is what you are looking for in a movie, inception might be right up your alley. If not, I can suggest a couple of good films that are specifically about dreams. Go watch ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"" and the anime ""Paprika"".My definitive score for inception is a 5/10.

The film's main focus is dreams, but I did not feel like I was in a dream, only a web of destruction at the hands of computer generated explosions! I think there is a certain creativity in Inception, however it was lost amidst the lack of comprehensive filmmaking and intelligent screen writing."

Batman begins was great but I wasn't that thrilled about dark Knight in spite of all the positive reviews it has received. Inception I always thought was a little bit overrated because I don't think it deserved all the Oscar nominations. Except the music category. The music was absolutely mesmerizing. Hans Zimmer is a genius. Some will find this theme a bit ridiculous but the direction alone has turned the movie completely around. I couldn't find a single minute boring. If one is watching a film like this, it should generally watched like a thriller. Not even the theme should be disclosed. The performances were great from everyone. Leonardo Dicaprio is indeed in a standard of his own. I has Ken Watanabe's best performance ever. Marion Cotillard and Ellen Page were perfect for their roles and the fine trivia behind their combination. They were once competent for the Oscar award once (Marion cotillard won the competition). Joseph Levitt Gordon, Tom Hardy, Dileep Rao and Michael Caine were all good. The music was incredible. Technical aspects were all exemplary.This movie should be experienced either in an extremely good theater or in a high definition home theater system were you won't have concentration removed in any manner. Watching a low quality print takes the very spirit of movie watching. Which is exactly what will happen to those who watched it on television with so many advertisements.Inception is indeed one of those different movies that shouldn't missed. Especially by those people who wish to see something different.9/10"

We're told that here's Leonardo, and here's an Asian guy who wants him to go into a dream, and that's it. Boom, now start the action. I will say that the concept was very good. It could have been a great movie if they would have left in some action, but cut out about 45 minutes of it and substituted character and dream-sequences/plot, rather than just wild chases/shoot-outs.

Nor just assume that you can pinpoint every viewer or put everybody in 3 categories.

You can also over-analyze this movie and list it's flaws (yes it has them as every movie has them and depending on your view of it, you might spot them and care or not), but apart from being visually stunning, it has a breathtaking story. And an ending that has been spoofed (at various internet sites), but that works very fine for the movie. Of course you could also feel that the end is a cheat. But again, I cannot tell you how to feel about this movie (or any other movie for that matter), I can only tell you, that it looks amazing and it made me chuckle for quite a few minutes in a breath-taking sequence.And no I did not get everything when I first watched it. I watched it a second time and there are still questions unanswered. Does or would something like that bother you? I didn't bother and the movie fully matched the expectations I had (this was my number 1 expected movie for 2010, the second most expected being ""Wall Street 2"").

Phrases like ""modern classic"" and ""landmark film"" made me think that I was in for something truly special in terms of film history along the lines of Citizen Kane and The Godfather.Turns out I wasn't, well not all the way anyway. I won't bother with the whole plot line, since it's very sprawling and complicated, but suffice it to say that my main disappointment with the film stems from the fact that the thematics of the story simply are too limited and ordinary compared to the potential impact of the film's gimmick: the fact that you can enter somebody's dream to steal information or plant ideas.The plot revolves mainly around industrial espionage, a theme which simply does nothing for me emotionally. Who cares if one industrial tycoon wants to stop another? The dream concept of the film is truly magical and innovative and is a very compelling feature of the film itself. But why in heaven's name marry it to something as pointless as industrial espionage? What happened to something like the fight for world domination? It would have given the film infinitely more punch if the plot had centered around some political intrigue in stead. Especially given the unstable nature of the world today with wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, huge climate issues, and so forth.The subplot involving Leonardo DiCaprio and Marion Cotillard's characters to me comes off very flat, their on screen chemistry not being very strong. This is a shame, for the premise of the subplot has great emotional potential.All in all, somewhat of a disappointment, despite the wallop one inevitably receives from the film's take on the concept of entering someone else's dreams."

I went into this film thinking this was going to be great but that just wasn't the case. I wasn't involved with the story.And story was the film's main selling point. Yeah, there's the visuals, yeah. They are spectacular, I won't lie. I love how the world moves with their minds and how they were able to get the actors to interact to an otherwise unusual world. And normally the effects is Hollywood's only strength, to draw their audience in with spectacular CGI. No, Inception wants to engross you into it's story.Many were lost. I just did not care.The story mostly revolves around dreams. It's like plugging into the Matrix and the Avatar. Now that I think of it, maybe that's what audiences like. Maybe the average moviegoer likes characters who become something that isn't themselves. Maybe they like characters who are strapped in to a bed or some sort, plugged into something, and then they are subjected into a different world where they have to fight to survive.But if this idea is what Hollywood is catching onto then believe me, it will get old fast. People would look back on this and wonder why audiences liked this in the first place. Inception is not one of those films that will be remembered with some of the greats, especially Nolan's own Batman films. It just doesn't have that kind of impact.

I am sure a lot of people must just be jumping on the band wagon by rating this movie highly, of perhaps pretending to get it, as I am positive I cannot be the only one that found this film over complex and just plain rubbish. In fact, I heard many of the people saying similar things as they left the cinema.I like a film to entertain me, and having heard everyone raving about this film I was bitterly disappointed to find it was a total ""try too hard"" yawn-fest. The concept was good, however it just didn't hit the mark and was thoroughly un-entertaining.

Just think of it as a movie about a multi-layered holodeck program, however, designed by programmers familiar with Counter Strike, cinematography, and disaster movies, since the idea of dreams in this film is quite banal and undreamlike, really - they are capitalist espionage tools with all the subconscious removed, or rather, translated into what is familiar to Nolan - a kind of Michael Bay alternate reality. The story, touted as complex, is complex only on the level that it is a heist movie - a fairly straightforward and very linear heist movie. There's no psychology (one character's statement that ""it's all about X"" is the entire psychological content of the film - the oldest trope in the book becomes a single, meaningless line) philosophy, ethics, and certainly no spirituality involved. I've seen some making comparisons to Solaris, either Tarkovsky's or Soderburgh's, but these are specious comparisons, made in a desperate attempt to elevate Nolan's vacant shenanigans. Don't believe it. The film is a hoax. It's fun, but it's a hoax.

The last hour of the film has to be the greatest theater experience I've ever had. I saw Inception twice, as I heard you will get more out of it the second time, which was very true.

Leonardo DiCaprio! wait... does this mean Dicaprio only acts in bad movies? no, because Leonardo DiCaprio can act, even though he always does the same thing and looks the same way he did in the last picture you've seen with him. it only means DiCaprio chooses to work on promising films that end up as no good. and why is Inception a bad picture? now here's the point! it's a stupid picture, with no mystery in it at all! am I joking?off course I'm not! the so called twists in the end are easy to come up with, so that when the clues are shown during the show, you can easily guess what they will turn out to be. what we really should be asking ourselves is this: if I had the choice between a James Bond movie and Inception, which one of the two would you prefer to see? answer: the James Bond movie. however, this is not the case with other movies directed by Christopher Nolan! Bond versus The Prestige? Bond loses. the same with The Dark Knight or Memento. and here's why: Inception is deception, because it's no good movie. I rest my case.

With a mixture of the directing and writing things got too deep and generally quite cryptic that felt a little hacky at times. It's not greatly structured nor does it seem well thought out, I think they tried to put so many twists and turns on the movie that it just wasn't that enjoyable; I totally understood it but the time they spent putting too many twists and turns in it could and should have been spent using deeper character development and general creativity opposed to just making things as non-linear as possible.4/10 and that's being generous"

After seeing Inception you will immediately want to watch it over again just to make sure you had caught every detail. As far as the cinematography goes - incredible.

IT's a great challenge. Christopher Nolan is a genius at creation. His movies are groundbreaking, and Inception is just another one of his phenomenal creations.The first 15 minutes were tough to figure out, but later you understand how those scenes were relevant to the story, and the rest of it really wasn't that hard for me - it made sense. The score was fantastic - I noticed that Nolan loves to infuse music into the film almost the whole time, rather than in key moments. It adds to the drama - I like it.The acting was very strong. Leo is a talented actor and did his thing in this movie. The rest of the cast was strong also, but I don't know if any of them will win major awards - except maybe the ex-wife. She was great. Nolan used a couple of actors from the Batman movies in there - that was interesting.One flaw I could pick on was that it wasn't clear what anyone else's motivation was to finish the Inception job. Clearly Leo's character had a goal, but I couldn't really tell why the others were so loyal and accommodating. Maybe I missed the monetary reward offered? The reality bend in Inception was done to perfection. Rang very similar to Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind in that regard.The movie was gorgeous to look at. The style was similar to his other recent films - and that's a very good thing.And the ending. What can I say, it was one of the most satisfying endings I've ever seen.

You do leave the movie with a heightened sense of awareness, but not with a different viewpoint on the world.I never cared that much for any of the characters, which is unusual for me - I often end up crying or otherwise being involved, so in that respect Inception seemed rather shallow. I kept trying to generate care, waiting for the arc of the script to take me over into the next level, but that point in the script never came.Technically, the special effects are pretty good, though they're kind of a one trick pony, or maybe a two trick pony. I was expecting much more in this regard. Sure, when I'm in a dream it seems real to my mind, but there are usually some really strange aspects too, like people whose faces are unclear, or like trying to speak but not being able, or like changing geography, or really weird, crazy stuff. None of this kind of thing happens in Inception, except for the occasional alteration in gravity.The basic idea, of never being sure what's real or what's constructed in your mind, has been done before. There's nothing wrong with that, since it's impossible to come up with new ideas about the human condition. But Rod Serling wrote some more compelling 30 minute TV scripts on the subject many years ago.My review makes it sound like a bad movie, which it is not, it's good enough. I guess I'm just reacting to incredible hype of people who think it's the greatest movie ever made. It certainly does not deserve a 9.4 rating, which is what IMDb is giving it as of this writing."

Leonardo DiCaprio plays Dom Cobb, who has the technology to enter people's dreams to obtain secret information. The climax comes when Cobb and his cohorts enter the dream of an executive, going deeper and deeper into his subconscious.Despite the high action, ""Inception"" is not really an action movie, but more of a psychological thriller. The movie has a slightly nonlinear plot, similar to ""Memento"" and ""The Prestige"". This helps to stress the dreamlike state that the movie depicts. If in fact the movie has any problem, it's that it's sometimes hard to tell when the characters are dreaming and when it's real life. But on the other hand, this also shows how smoothly Nolan lets the story flow. Watching the movie, I came to realize things about my own dreams that I had never previously thought about. The apparent descent into insanity and links to Cobb's past bring to mind ""Insomnia"".Much like how Nolan put a new spin on the Batman franchise, ""Inception"" takes psychological thrillers to the next step. It even goes beyond ""The Matrix"". All in all, I certainly recommend it.Also starring Ken Watanabe, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Marion Cotillard, Ellen Page, Tom Hardy, Cillian Murphy, Dileep Rao, Tom Berenger and Michael Caine (who has so far starred in every one of Nolan's movies since ""Batman Begins"")."

All of these claims are completely and utterly misguided and wrong.Inception is a movie unlike any other. It combines heart-stopping action, mind bending psychological concepts, and deep emotional conflicts, wraps them in a tight, perfectly edited package, and drop kicks you with them in the face. The cool part is that you won't be surprised at how little you understand, but rather how much you understand. The scripting and pacing is so well planned and pieced together and everything is explained in the perfect amount of detail, which serves to make the end of the movie a mind-blowing climax of epic proportions.Scoring by Hans Zimmer is to die for. It's a mysterious combination of elements of Batman, Bourne, and Quantum of Solace, which are all revolutionary scores, and it completes the movie. But let's be serious, everything completes this movie. Joseph Gordon-Levitt, DiCaprio, and Ellen Paige all turn in rock star performances. The only character that feels underdeveloped is ""Fischer,"" who comes off as cold, but whose emotional transformation isn't entirely convincing. Luckily, the rest of the movie is so engrossing at every moment that this does not detract from the overall experience. Nolan doesn't need to fall back on high-buck CGI either. The sets, locales, and visuals are stunning without being overbearing.These gorgeous visuals, ludicrous editing, brilliant scoring, a synergistic cast, and a plot that makes you think and rewards you for your mental effort combine to transform this from a movie into an amazing mental journey."

It's a superficial action film that admittedly looks visually nice, but there's no real drama. It actually bored me.

I've seen it months ago and since then I haven't give it much of a thought. But now it hit me from nowhere, I finally see what the essence of this piece of art is- it's about the art of manipulation.There are only a handful of movies, every now and then a new one is made, for which it can be truly said that it represents some kind of a ""document"" or at least an amazing meditation of how we already live today and how we will live in the near future. In this regard I would put Inception right next to the Matrix. The later is in essence a film about a completely ignorant super-used workforce of humans, who haven't actually moved from their wombs yet, but at the same time they have computer generated illusions about how they reached ""the peak of civilization"". This kind of humanity is completely immature (but not pure, or innocent) until a New man comes from somewhere and decides to move from this cave of ignorance and unconscious slavery. Most of them stay there, some by their own free will, because it's pleasant.Now the key thing about this movie, is not just that it's a long ""journey into the mind"", but what matters is what comes out. It takes inception to make perception. That's the whole trick. The conciseness is a product and the subject of manipulation doesn't know a bit about it. He wrongfully thinks that his consciousness ""mirrors"" the world ""as it is"", but it doesn't, it never did and it never will.Inception is a pure and plastic example of how we live in the 21. century. We live in a world where there is an infinite amount of media inception of ideas on a daily level. All of it is very well planned and targeted, nothing spontaneous about it. And yet we still egoistically think how our minds ""mirror"" the world as it is and how independent we are. We cannot except or even know that our minds are a product, that our perceptions are a product. To realize that, one would at least need to ""plug off"" for a substantial amount of time from this. But that is costly, so nobody does it. In the end our own defense mechanism screw us up, because we refuse to recognize what kind of fools we are."

I could care less for any of the characters, I wasn't emotionally invested at all.This isn't the first time Christopher Nolan tried to take Film Art concepts and commercialize it. This is an attempt at making a surrealism commercial. The problem with trying to make a surreal movie for the general public is that you have to make it understandable to the masses.

Surrealist films like, Un Chien Andalou, are chaotic like dreams.Big visuals and action sequences aren't enough anymore, if you can't get me care about what drives the story, you're going to lose me."

Plot is very well written and done on screen, made me watch few times before I realized everything.It's like a movie you want to see alone, so you could somehow keep up with the story. Lucid dreams came to my mind almost in the beginning, it kept my interest in the film.I felt like I'm watching two movies at the same time, no actual characters that you could get similar to, that was maybe good, movie itself was already confusing enough.The end-part was so boring that I almost fell asleep, very well done though :)Final inception, I liked the theme and the movie, only thing I missed was something that get similar to. Dream in a dream etc. wasn't exactly my normal dreaming.9/10"

I felt like this movie was stuck in mud and the only way to break it up was to but some intense action sequences, which made it seem to much like the matrix.I will not say I hated this movie, but did not enjoy it the way I thought I would. I love dream/reality movies it my favorite topic it just seems like this movie went to close to the matrix instead of making a thought provoking movie about dreams/reality and what is real what is not..."

That is unheard of. Not to say it is not a great film, but I am a little shocked by this. I give it an 8...Long story short, Christopher Nolan is a genius. He has a ton of films on the top 250 list, and still has along career ahead of him. This film was both written and directed by him, and the story and visuals are striking. Some of the story I think is a bit iffy (if you are too critical it might have major holes) but if you are accepting its basic premise, it is a solid concept that has not been explored before.Leonardo DiCaprio plays Cobb, and Leo is always a good lead. The family issues here tread close to where ""Shutter Island"" tread, but this only shows where that other film fell short (as much as I enjoyed both).Joseph Gordon-Levitt plays Arthur, and was for me the most pleasant surprise of the film. I still have a hard time accepting him as a legitimate actor and not just a cheesy, comedic character. But here I was moved. He did his own stunts during what was by far my favorite scene of the film, and although he still looks twenty (he was 29 at the time this film came out) he has lots of potential.Ellen Page was a decent Ariadne (her most adult role yet), and it was nice to see Nolan veterans Cillian Murphy and Michael Caine back for more. And a special shout-out to Pete Postlethwaite (Maurice Fischer) in what was one of his very final roles.Anyway, a must-see if ever there was one in the last few years. 9 out of 10? Maybe. 6th greatest film ever? I don't know... but definitely one of those rare gems of the last decade."

As soon as I realized, what this movie was all about, I just wanted to drop it. Chris Nolan, The Dark Knight is the best ever(due to Heath Ledger), but this one? It is beautifully executed, excellently done. It would be a masterpiece film, but this plot, this nonsense! Nonsense is the best way to describe this. There are movies, which are complicated, and I love'em. But to over-complicate a nonsense? Watch South Park's new episode(Insheeption)! That one tells you exactly, what this movie is like. Do not compare it with Matrix. That one is credible, possible, you can find logic in it, but not in Inception. I do not remember the last time, I wanted out of a cinema after 10 minutes!

There is no plot or scenario when the writers or director did get stacked, it was very easy: it's a dream. I thought the film was all about the manipulation of the brain and effect on human behavior. But after 30 minutes I was looking at ordinary action film with people shooting but not did get hurt, buildings that erased, turned or collapsed.

The actual conflict in Inception is just an after-thought to appease. Cobb's issue about wanting to see his children is so tired and played out it is almost laughable. With all the attention that went into the dream process, maybe Nolan could have spent a little more time with human elements of the film.Whether it's a wife who killed her children or a wife who killed herself and left children, we are tired of Leo as the grieving husband (Inception/Shutter Island). Clearly this film was to showcase cleverness in concept and effects. The story is a bare-bones, hackneyed joke.Even the mission is a yawner. Who cares about the rich kid and his rich dad- you don't even get to know them so why care? None of the relationships are below the surface so there is nothing invested in the story.Movies are about relationship, conflict and story. All of these elements are after-thoughts in INCEPTION! This is strictly a concept film whose execution of CGI is way more special then it's attention to story."

After about 45 minutes into it I found myself sorely disappointed with the acting, the story progression, and the development of the characters (no genuine or believable character development, other than the obvious and predictable growth of DiCaprio). Watanabe, Page, and Gordon-Levitt demonstrated some of the poorest acting I've seen since Con Air. Watanabe was difficult to understand 90% of the time. Gordon-Levitt's attempt to portray a cool & steely partner was grossly unbelievable. Page came across aggravating and, in many ways, out of place. The Bottom-line: I believe that the movie did a good job of hypnotizing everyone into thinking that the Matrix want-to-be story was deep or intriguing.

I had a feeling of having seen it all before during this movie - I was constantly thinking of Robin Williams in What Dreams May Come where his wife is trapped in purgatory and also Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind. By the end we were all waiting for it to end in my group and comments when filing out of the cinema in Australia were much the same from the rest of the crowd. It actually feels like a nightmare which I guess is what the director intended. On the upside it had a fantastic all star cast but they struggled to make this mess coherent. Cillian Murphy - still waiting to hit the Hollywood big time he deserves - tried his best with his limited script but he really needs a better part than this. The music was quite jarring all the way through, and sounds near identical to DiCaprio's last movie; the much better Shutter Island. The constant strings with trumpet bellows are meant to add tension, but after you hear the same sequence of music for over two hours it gets a little annoying to say the least.

The world of dreams is a world of opportunities to make a perfect film but too much dreams kill the dream. I find the locations of the filming a bit gray and as one of the characters said: why didn't they dream something sunny. As for the plot, since the beginning of the film you keep asking yourself is he dreaming this or not, which gives the movie another tone. Also I find the plot and the characters a bit gray as well as for their motives. But if you watch it as an action film you will be entertained. For me this film doesn't deserve to be in the top ten IMDb."

It is Nolan's true masterpiece and one of the most original pieces of fiction ever put on film. The story, although multi-layered and complex, is incredibly engrossing and a wonder to behold on screen. The movie follows Dom Cobb(DiCaprio) as he leads a specialized team, tasked with putting an idea inside the mind of Robert Fischer Jr.(Cillian Murphy). This task is called Inception. Cobb specializes in the Extraction of ideas from people's minds in their dreams, but Inception is an entirely different story. Removing an idea from a person's mind proves easier because the person has already thought it, but adding an idea is something that can't be done without carefully manipulating the mind to create the idea on it's own. This is the premise of 'Inception', and that's only the surface. There are so many layers to the plot that it's almost impossible to divulge even a fraction of the story in any less than a few pages. The script, which took ten years to write, is pure brilliance. As the film progresses it only becomes more intriguing, even up to the very end. The acting is superb across the board. The standout being DiCaprio, but the entire cast delivers amazing performances. 'Inception' is visually dazzling and unlike anything i've ever seen on film. But even the amazing visuals don't detract from the depth and complexities of the plot. With amazing cinematography and a remarkably well-crafted and fitting original score from Hans Zimmer, there isn't an area where the film doesn't shine. This is truly Nolan's best, and that is definitely saying something.10/10"

The actors have to deal with so much exposition, the strain and boredom is practically palpable. Dialogue this obviously for the audience's benefit and this inorganic is completely undeliverable. It's not nearly so complicated that this level of explication is necessary, either.The biggest problem, however, is that this is not a sci-fi film or a thoughtful drama or the incredibly rare gem of a film that transcends any kind of genre that it wants to be. It's an action spectacle and that's all. It's not deep and the characters are issues with name-tags. The massive, driving climax full of supposed suspense left me unmoved and thinking about other things because I really didn't care about these thinly drawn stick figures. Additionally, the thinks-it's-very-clever ending was the cheapest trick in the book and it cheats at its own game.People comparing this to The Matrix (a film that really does rise above its genre and its spectacle, where even the minor characters feel fleshed out) aren't doing it any favours."

I can honestly say that this film has surpassed anything I have ever seen before, despite the hype.I was gripped from start to finish. An amazing concept backed up with emotion and even some groundbreaking action scenes. I spent the entirety of last night trying to get my head around what could have actually happened, such is the depth of the story. Never before has a film had such an impact on me - I woke this morning to the realisation that I had several dreams last night which were very uneasy, for the first time in years.This film is the reason I've finally signed up to this website. I'm a massive fan of films such as 'The Shawshank Redemption' and 'The Godfather', but in my opinion, this raises the bar. And that's coming from somebody who is generally not the biggest Sci-Fi fan.If there's ever a film that the masses should rush out to the cinema to see it is this, before it's too late.

With this movie Nolan, perhaps one of the finest directors of all time creates himself a new genre which defies all the other ones. Science fictions with dramatic stories and improvisations surrounded with intellectual aura. Some say that 4-D cant be done. This movie undoes that belief too. You can feel the aura of beauty surrounding you while watching the movie. Nolan has improvised himself on all aspects of movie making. The seat gripping scenes, amazing dialogs and the spectacular movie telling is quite evident on the screen. The story races with an amazing speed but manages to keep you to be right on the track. The movie comes up with a rare collaboration of perfection in all aspects. DiCaprio dazzles with another award winning performance. I would really feel sorry for the Oscars if they miss the privilege to honor him this year. People tend to compare this with a segment of classics like the matrix, star-wars. Well actually it surpasses them all. These movies are based on an IDEA. And they stop at there. A single idea and the story is segmented on that. Nolan has the impeccable capacity to pick up a dramatic story with in an idea an build a piece of art from it. Thats what distinguishes him from the herd. This movie is another such movie, though this is not exactly another movie.Watch this movie in the theaters. You really need to kill piracy for this movie. Final verdict... 10/10"

I don't think the story came out quite the way Nolan had hoped, after working on it for over a decade. In my view the story is basically a combination of Vanilla Sky meets The Matrix, but really it ends up being less meaningful than both (A combination of the mystical waking dream and the matrix of consciousness). This is Nolan's version of Edgar Allan Poe's A Dream Within A Dream, or the like. However I don't think the film really comes across this way as well as it should, or especially, the way it was meant to.Take this kiss upon the brow! And, in parting from you now, Thus much let me avow- You are not wrong, who deem that my days have been a dream; Yet if hope has flown away in a night, or in a day, In a vision, or in none, Is it therefore the less gone? All that we see or seem Is but a dream within a dream.I stand amid the roar Of a surf-tormented shore, And I hold within my hand Grains of the golden sand- How few! yet how they creep Through my fingers to the deep, While I weep- while I weep! O God! Can I not grasp Them with a tighter clasp? O God! Can I not save One from the pitiless wave? Is all that we see or seem But a dream within a dream? The film overall feels forced and clunky, it lacks any kind of good rhythm. For me to see this film ranked in the top 15 films ever made according to the IMDb voters only goes to prove one thing; The IMDb top 250 list is good for nothing at all but a laugh. I thought Inception was pretty good. However pretty good is stretching it as far as I would ever go. This film is a long long way from great.7/10"

Because of this I just couldn't see how ""complex"" and ""amazing"" it was. The story is about a thief who can travel through dreams. Inception is the idea of changing someones decisions based on infiltrating their dreams and affecting their subconscious.

The bad rating I gave this movie has nothing to do with the actors' performances.I gave this a bad rating because the writing was just bad. The CONCEPT of the movie was excellent. When I first saw the trailer, my imagination went wild. The scope of where you could go and what you could do with a concept like inception in people's dreams is almost endless.But, where did they run with it? Guns? Explosions? Grand Theft Auto? Matrix wannabe? These are the words that came to mind when I watched this.And the plot, if that's what you call it, is nothing. It's convoluted minus the imagination, mystery, and intelligence. It's like they made it complicated so it could SEEM intelligent. But trust me, it's not! About 1/2 to 2/3 into the movie, the ending became VERY predictable. Even so, I thought, ""It's about the journey not the ending. Right?"" Except the journey sucked. How come everybody in this movie only dreams about automatic weapons? I know, I know. There are a bunch of explanations in the movie, but the explanations are terrible and not thorough enough to be believable. For example, the characters explain the assault weapons in the dreams by saying the subconscious had been militarized.What kind of stupid explanation is that? Am I supposed to take that seriously? It seems like the movie is just asking for an excuse to become a pseudo-Matrix action flick. Except the Matrix was much better than this.Well... What a waste of a good concept... but mindless action flicks can be fun, even when they continuously, pretentiously claim to be thought-provoking..... But then there's the looooong drawn out mushy ending that breaks up the action and isn't befitting an action flick at all.So, congratulations Hollywood. You managed to take a good concept of a movie with a great cast, remove all imagination and intelligence, while simultaneously turning it into a mediocre action flick with a terrible ending.Hollywood fails again... 4/10 stars"

It's absolutely essential for your life to watch this movie. Once you watch it, you will experience pure genius from an author when trying perfection, and joy when you feel he made it. The cast, action, music, effects, plot and subtext are combined in a way most directors only can dream of. Nolan has proved, once again, that quality, intelligence and talent can also work in mainstream industry. From this moment on, most films will be boring, simple and not worth watching.

Having already ordered my tickets and being unable to change my mind, the words ""Hold on to your heads for a real brain bender"" put me off instantly. This description of the film made me expect something along the lines of 'The butterfly effect' or 'Donnie Darko', neither of which I fully got my head around and mainly watched for the hunky male leads.However I couldn't be more wrong about this masterpiece of a film, I cannot really summarise in words how much it will make your jaw drop continuously throughout and highly recommend that you see this.In conclusion - Phenomenal performances from everyone on screen - Fantastic music - Fantastic settings - Pure genius of a story line - Flawless Do not miss out on this, fasten your seat-belts to be truly blown away."

The story is plain and not interesting. The movie drags on way to long in boring not so much important it could have been faster convo's. The movie length is just that long because of the long slow conversations and slow motions.But what gets annoying is they don't apply the logic they set in the rules. 1. Tip over you come back out (car flipping over is tipping over). 2. Weightless only works on one dream but doesn't apply magically to another. (Winter Wonder Land has its own gravity i guess)Overall this movie is a waste of time and certainly not re-watchable.Rating of 2 because the non-standard Hollywood movie with new ideas was kinda nice.

The weaknesses are on story and message side. Plot is pretty obvious. Overall Inception is mixing some 007 stuff we've seen in several other occasions and something matrix like with on-the-surface multileveled story. Worst of all, the message of the movie (which deals somehow with the love, reality and letting go of the sad past) is left vague and superficial. It simply did not touch me. To put it short, Inception seemed came through to me as a bagful of old tricks covered with some special effects.Movie definitely is not worth the current 9.2 rating in IMDb. Being social media professional, the unreasonably high rating of an average movie leads me to wonder if social media has been commercially manipulated."
344,415,0.5773514,0.3561582,0.06649033,1,Deception,"I went to see this film with very high expectations due to raving reviews (Roger Ebert a.o.), but unfortunately it turned out to be nothing more than an action flick with too much action and overdone special effects. The story is about dream tapping, whereby people are able to step into and figure in other people's dreams. That is about as ""deep"" as the film gets, no double layers (other than tapping into a dream within a dream), no philosophical double doors or anything else that could be slightly intellectually challenging for an educated viewer. With the budget that was made available for this film (USD 160m) they should at least have hired a couple of professional writers to make it work. Dialogues are very poor. At one point the girl, his own apprentice, explains Leonardo DiCaprio in a panicky situation that ""it's a projection, remember"", as if Leo's character wouldn't know that. And why would a normal person's (not a Navy Seal's) subconscious (in this case Robert Fischer's) bring in dozens of guys with uzi's etc from all corners when under stress? It makes no sense at all. Without all the special effects it could have been a much more powerful film, despite the poor storyline. By far it does not stand up to a film like The Sixth Sense (much less special effects, much more thrilling), or even A Single Man with Colin Firth which I saw this same weekend. We know that everybody dreams while sleeping, but the mystery of dreaming has nothing to do with special effects or spectacular shootouts. When we dream we touch on the unknown, and that is what creates the suspense and mystery after we wake up. That Christopher Nolan, who apparently is mesmerized by dreams or why else would he have written this nonsense, did not touch on this but on the contrary just threw money at ridiculous visual effects and bullet holes, is anybody's guess. To me this film is a demonstration of this director's pretentiousness and his creativity that only goes so far as blowing up stuff. I don't understand how some writers in serious newspapers can compare Christopher Nolan to Stanley Kubrick. The score is 0 - 15. Luckily Nolan is not 40 yet, so hopefully he will come back with something more stimulating out of the money he will make from Inception."

Since his indie breakout ""Memento,"" writer/director Christopher Nolan has ascended the ranks of major Hollywood filmmaking, injecting his work with a sense of wonder and intelligence; yet like ""The Dark Knight"" (a great, yet somewhat flawed film) my feelings toward ""Inception"" (those I can clearly rationalize, that is) wind up a few notches below where I believe they should be. While the film -- centered around a group of ""dream hackers"" (headed by Leonardo DiCaprio) looking to plant an idea in a corporate heir's (Cillian Murphy) headspace -- has its share of visually stunning setpieces and fascinating ideas (it's nice to see some Jungian concepts get their toes wet -- if not immersed -- here), the ultimate result is overlong, overindulgent, and marked by distracting, unsatisfying diversions (the prime offender being the haunted, memory-based relationship between DiCaprio and wife Marion Cotillard) and leaden exposition that completely deadens a sometimes-glacial pace. And for a film about dreams and their origin in the mind, Nolan's action-movie transitions come across as counterintuitive: instead of reminding us of the jagged inconsistency and incoherence of dreams, the jerky cutting merely comes across as...well, just incoherent (which becomes particularly tiresome when the film dissolves into dream-within-a-dream-within-a-dream action-movie territory in the final act). ""Inception"" is most fascinating in its first hour, which lays the ground rules of dream-logic and how dream-worlds ""work""; once it settles into the main plot, it derails somewhat, and it soon becomes clear that Nolan, in his attempt to not only dazzle, thrill, and stimulate the collective consciousness of the viewer, but build on the astronomical expectations established by ""The Dark Knight,"" has a reach that far surpasses his grip."

The next 2 1/2 hours flew by with a movie that entertained like a big budget movie and challenged the mind like a small ""indie"" flick. As I tried to figure out exactly what happened (which of course will be my opinion since this is the kind of movie that will be open to hundreds of interpretations) I realized I needed to give it another look so I went back the next day and watched it again. I noticed a few slight ""flaws"" the second time through but these were small details that can be rationalized depending on your point of view as to what the movie really was about. Is this a all a dream? Is it real and everything went as planned? Are portions real and the end a dream? There will be countless debate on this and we know Mr. Nolan will never tell. What I do know after this and the sensational ""Dark Knight"" I am now in the ""Christopher Nolan is far and away the most creative person in the film industry"" camp. I strongly recommend to everyone - go see this and form your own conclusions - this movie does not preach, but just entertains and challenges. The best movie in years - nothing has been close!"

However, the expectations were tower high as Chris Nolan is one of my favorite directors and Leo is my favorite star. I prefer never to miss his movies.Merits First : Story , Screenplay and Direction : 10/10 ,Direction was consistent in all the places, didn't feel continuity errors, Story and Screenplay were so engaging that involved the viewers at every point in the movie, challenges them and leaves them enthralled, confused , wanting for more.CGI / Special Effects : 8/10 , Got patchy in a couple of places,specially the Paris Cafe Scene.Acting : 10/10 Totally Blown away by the performances of Leo, Ellen Page , Joseph Gorden Lewitt , Tom Hardy are exceptionally good .Technicals , Cinematography , Casting : 10/10 Nolan just paints the canvas with beautiful dreams and subconsciousness of people.Background Score needs a special mention as it adds to the mood of the film.Inception is the story of Dom Cobb(Leo) and his team of ""Extractors"" , who deal with a special kind of security called subconscious security. They enter the dreams of subjects, extract their secrets from the dreams. Cobb is a fugitive of American government and corporates. He stays in Japan and want to get back to his family. A Powerful Japanese client offers him a deal to give his life back in return for his life and lift all the bans on him in return for planting an idea in his competitor's mind. Cobb decides to take a ""Leap of Faith"" and starts collecting his team for this. He meets Ariadne, a young and bright architect from his father's university , and Eames who leads him to Yusuf, a chemist with deep sleep sedatives. Together, they start working on the mission to plant the dream in Fischer Jrs Idea.No spoiler's here I will not reveal anything from suspense but on a whole the movie deserves a standing ovation as execution of such a script is a very difficult task, Nolan has handled it quite efficiently. The anti-gravity scenes were too good. The cinematography , the creation of dream worlds , the concept of architects were so good that you can believe that the time required to build the script and its depth took 10 years and the movie was pitched to the producers just after memento."
350,427,0.18033615,0.41301942,0.40664434,8,It's a good film but not great!,"The whole concept of Inception is about planting ideas in the subconscious of another's mind. Christopher Nolan wrote, directed, and produced this film which has an impressive array of special effects, sequences, and issues about time. What is five minutes of dreaming can be an hour in the dream-state? Whatever it is, the cast is quite brilliant. Poor Sir Michael Caine who is not used enough along with Peter Postlethwaite OBE who is on for just as much. They are both great actors. The cast includes Oscar nominee Leonardo DiCaprio, Joseph Gordon-Leavitt, Ellen Page, Ken Watanbe, Marion Cotillard, and Cillian Murphy. The cast is first rate as well as the special and visual effects. There is a lot going on here and I was disappointed to learn Fischer's secret but I won't spoil it for you. The plot is more corporate espionage. Anyway, everybody in the dream game is hooked up by wires to the same machine of some kind. It reminded me of the film, Coma, where their bodies were suspended in the air. That was scary enough. I think the mind is an untouched part and not used enough but I wouldn't mess with it like this because there is always the trouble that you can't get back to reality which may not be so bad after all."

Dark Knight was super incredible but it is amazing how a guy can produce another equally amazing master piece.Story, acting, directing are all rock solid. Carrying such a complicated story can turn out to be a disaster but Christoper Nolan has a perfect control over the progress of story.He plays the audiences' mind in a high level and never fails to lose the composure and intensity of the story through the entire running time. To that such an intense and emotional story, he also inserted appropriate amt of humor to provide some relaxations.All the CG is wisely used and provides jaw dropping experiences.Acting wise, Leonardo Diccaprio does what he does basically providing his overall great acting. All the others are also superbly casted. Especially the guy from 500 Summer is better than I expected. He looks serious enough and does provide some funny moments.Again, I am very impressed with what Christoper Nolan pulled off. In my opinion, he is actually becoming one of those legendary directors such as Hitchcock. Nolan got famous for stories dealing Human's psychology. This is another those stories but in a gigantic scale.Usually many directors fail to produce good movies with a lot of money but this Christopher Nolan has no limitations. he did that in Dark Knight and also in this movie, 'Inception'.I look forward to seeing his next possibly masterpiece film."

Not only was the acting brilliant, the story superb, and just the overall concept and execution flawless, but I left the theatre completely mind blown. I left in a state of wonder, a state that I have yet to come out of even though it has been 8 hours since seeing it.""Inception"" has caused me to ponder the nature of dreams and reality, made me just sit down and think, something so many films nowadays do not do. I am 16, and I am disappointed at how so many films do not strive to be anything special now. The main aim is to pull in as much money in the box office as possible. James Cameron is even re-releasing ""Titanic"" in 3-D and I am dying to know why? What is the need? More money?! However Nolan's ""Inception"" was simply exquisite in every possible way. It contained romance, comedy, suspense, fantasy, reality, and anything else you could ask for. There are going to be the reviewers that say this movie was too confusing, or that it was nowhere near as good as everyone is making it out to be, but I implore each and every one of you to go see this movie and make the decision for yourself. This is a film that more films need to strive to be like. Far too many of the films that have come out in the past ten years are lacking in one aspect or another, but ""Inception"" is truly a masterpiece."

Will Toy Story 3 make or break my childhood dreams? But out of all of these obscurities, the knowledge that Inception will, in all likelihood be as overlooked at the upcoming Academy Awards as Nolan's last film: The Dark Knight, is the most frustrating.Unlike his iconic mish-mash chronology of his prior filmography, the narrative (though not for once without it's thought provoking logic) generally remains undemanding and plausible.Dom Cobb (DiCaprio) understands the infectious power of an idea or otherwise known as: 'The greatest parasite'. Notwithstanding his highly perilous job, which is usually to remove an idea from a set target, he now has to, in order to save his family, triumph the widely considered impossibility of an inception: The ability to plant an idea within the mind of a victim rather than remove it.Less than a year fresh from his first class Shutter Island performance, DiCaprio firmly remains a beacon of admiration to aspiring young actors yet again. Undeniably a riveting performance. Juno's Ellen Page helps clarify sense of the psychotic dream state as a newly recruited member of the group, making the triumphant tale and importance of Inception less confusing than expected. Support also comes from talented Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Marion Cotillard and Michael Caine – who to Nolan refers to as his lucky charm; not that he needs one.Nolan, having now just finished his 7th film, with four of his previous works among the IMDb top 250, all with certified freshness and a scarcely small amount of Oscar nominations, at the very least deserves a Best Director Nomination for the Memento movie making maestro. And sadly it looks like we'll have to wait a long time to find that outSummer disappointments be gone. Inception is here."

Before I first watched this film, I was told that it would be complex and mind-blowing so I expected something like Nolan's earlier The Prestige (2006) which was masterful and one of my favourite films. Instead, we get a shallow imitation of that style. Inception is complex just for the sake of being complex - it doesn't add much value to the film, and the complexity is just overloading the audience's working memory which is not a clever technique at all. The characters were the worst part of the film. Apart from the main characters, they basically have no existence outside their role in the mission. We don't have any other reason to care about them. After a point, I just completely stopped caring whether they succeeded. Nothing felt compelling or of much consequence. I actually cared more about Cilian Murphy's character than the protagonists, to be honest. Because I lost my investment in the film, it just dragged out and became boring, especially some of the generic action scenes like the one in the snow. The ending is just cheap ambiguity rather than anything meaningful. That said, there were some good things about the film that I enjoyed. The visuals and effects were great, such as the transforming cities and the zero gravity. The best part was Hans Zimmer's score which remains one of my favourite soundtracks. Those aspects almost made up for the flaws - almost."

360,437,0.17208557,0.485099,0.34281534,4,Not as complicated as it seems,"Famous for a script that was so complicated even the actors themselves didn't understand what was going on, Inception is one of Christopher Nolan's most famous films, which, given his string of popular movies, is saying something. It's a science fiction film that takes dream analysis to several new levels. In the film, it's Leonardo DiCaprio's job to put his clients to sleep, then enter their dream subconscious and find out information they need. It gets much more complicated, but for the sake of saving your brain, that's the plot in a nutshell.Nolan recruited an all-star supporting cast, including Michael Caine, Marion Cotillard, Ellen Page, Cillian Murphy, Tom Hardy, Ken Watanabe, Tom Berenger, and Joseph Gordon-Levitt, in one of his first dramatic roles. While everyone tries very hard to give serious, dramatic performances to thrill and move the audience, it doesn't always come across that way. Marion seems like she's trying to remember how to speak English, Joe seems like he's desperately trying to get the audience to forget he was ever in 3rd Rock from the Sun, and Leo looks like he's out of tears and thinks a wrinkled face will be just as convincing.The special effects of the film absolutely deserved the hype and the Academy Award, as scenes literally bend and crumble into one another as the different dream sequences blend. If you love movies with incredible special effects, this is a must-see.If you even mention the title to anyone who's seen it, it'll no doubt spark an hour long discussion about what the story and ending meant. I watched the film, and with the exception of a couple of little details during the dream-within-a-dream sequences, I understood it perfectly. To me, the ending was not one that needed discussion, so I don't quite understand the reason behind everyone's endless debates. However, if that type of story intrigues you, you might want to watch this one with your friends so you can stay up late afterwards and talk about what you think it meant."

For the first 20 minutes, I couldn't believe just how bad this film was. Drop the viewer into a complete state of confusion to look good?.....except that this is always a risky strategy, one which a only few films have eloquently pulled off, the nearest comparable being The Matrix, which this most certainly isn't- although it tries so hard to be in terms of style and delivery. Yes the CGI and special effects are at times breathtaking. It's just such a shame that the storyline was utterly ridiculous, disjointed, confusing dispassionate and so very, very boring. Great effects DO NOT make for a great film necessarily. A note on casting. Like the film, this is truly awful....what on earth was Leonardo Di Caprio thinking?!

I know I'm swimming against the tide of public opinion here, but while I was hugely excited about seeing Inception back when it came out, I was absolutely crushed on first viewing. I found it terribly written (the film begins with enough exposition scenes to fill a normal film's running time!), incomprehensible (editing was all over the place, action dull and repetitive), visually disappointing (all the best bits were revealed in the trailer and were all contained in the exposition scenes rather than having anything to do with the story) and with a concept that just didn't hold water (the dream sequences seemed to always resemble Matrix out-takes and were held together by a logic that just wasn't very dream-like)!Perhaps if Nolan had a studio breathing down his neck and someone to revise his shaky script this could have turned out well, but after the success of TDK he can effectively write his own ticket and is (sadly) free to churn out this kind of lazy and self-indulgent snooze-fest. The same thing happened with Peter Jackson after LOTR with King Kong (an hour too long, too much freedom etc.)Hans Zimmer's incredible score was about the only positive I took out of Inception (Zimmer's brilliant scores are increasingly the glue that holds Nolan's films together and makes them seem better than they are). Despite his obvious talents and love of film (I love him for shooting Batman stuff in IMAX 70mm!) Nolan has some very bad habits (mainly relying on his and his brother's writing) which I think really hamper his films these days. I loved TDK, but it frustrates me in almost equal measure, and though I haven't seen The Dark Knight Rises yet, I will go in with very low expectations based on his apparently dwindling form."

Leo DiCaprio is in it, and I have a VERY soft spot for him :) and 2. My brother also wanted to see it. So I went along, expecting some nice Leo eye-candy and gun fights. Nothing more. This film was AMAZING! I absolutely loved it. It had everything in it: outstanding acting, an excellent score, mind blowing special effects and a very intricate, detailed plot. There was exactly the right balance of drama/Leo and action/guns , making it an ideal film for either gender. The film was so clever, and I was absolutely glued to the screen the whole time. I was overwhelmed, because it was so much better than what I was expecting. In my opinion, this film is very underrated, and I believe that it is by far the best film of the decade, maybe even the century. The only bad thing that is if you're slow like me, you may need to watch it a few times to fully understand the plot, but I'm not complaining. I was also very disappointed that this didn't make the number 1 or 2 spot on the IMDb top 250, because it should be there. Absolutely.

I would not consider myself as the biggest fan of Nolan, but i have liked all of his films, so maybe i already fall into that category. Having seen all the praise this was getting, i was expecting something grand in the theater... and something grand is what i got, and more.While the acting isn't the film's strong suit, it's not by any means bad. Leonardo did a very convincing job as Cobb, and i was impressed by Marion's performance as Mal. Joseph Gordon did good, and Tom Hardy was just amazing. I might get bashed here, but i also liked Ellen Page. Cillian Murphy was amazing for me as well.But what this film did for me was having me real tight on the edge of my seat. Nolan scripted the film in an amazing way, filled with ambiguity and just plain awesomeness that i don't know how to describe. I liked the whole mission and how Nolan boarded the dream levels. I found it very original, although i haven't watched that many films about dreams. I found the action scenes pretty good and all the technical thing in the film are great. I'd like to see Harry Potter 7 get the Oscar for either Art Direction or visuals (because i am a fan), but i know that won't happen because inception does really deserve them.I won't lie and say that even though i did understand most of the film, the saito business left me confused, so i backed my theory up by reading some threads in here. I actually thought he was not dreaming anymore, and even if he was, it was a happy ending to see him with his kids once again. Needless to say the audience gasped at the totem both times i watched it.The score was really fitting, but i still want John Powell's How to train your dragon score to win the Oscar.Pretty amazing blockbuster film, showing how Nolan pretty much is one of the best filmmakers of our time.

When I say that, I don't mean extremely artsy or emotional, or a movie that attempts to get a reaction out of the audience by toying with current social issues. It's a movie that was precariously thought over for years, and then put together with an amazing cast, a thoughtful, original storyline, and stunning visuals. To complain that the story is too complex is ridiculous; It makes you pay attention, and somehow people perceive that as a bad thing. Christopher Nolan (the director) was not attempting to make his movie as complicated as possible to make it a great movie; ""Inception"" is a great movie because is has more depth than movies like ""Avatar"" and ""The Social Network"". The people that I know that disliked this movie (which was very few) typically didn't like it because of its ""loudness"", as in explosions and action sequences, and because it was ""confusing"".Overall, there is little reason to not like this movie, let alone give it one star (what are you people thinking? You really think that this movie is a complete and utter failure!?). Like Cobb said, ""They say we only use a fraction of our brain's true potential. Now that's when we're awake. When we're asleep, we can do almost anything"". Maybe the people who dislike this movie need to watch is while asleep, to fully activate their thinking potential.""Inception"" is simply a very well-rounded, utterly brilliant movie that will bring you into a world of folding cities and twisting hallways. ""Inception"" will bring you in and fill your head with its complexity and perfection, and may even plant an idea inside of you, so be ready, because in ""Inception"", your mind is the scene of the crime."

Everything in that movie is superb : the acting, the special effects (minimun CGI sh*t), the soundtrack, the plot, the editing, the direction, etc. I have no doubt in my mind that the masterpiece called Inception will be remembered for years even decades to come since the movie is open to interpretation like many science fiction classics such as Blade Runner and 2001. For those who have not seen Inception yet, do yourself a favour and watch it now. Don't miss Hollywood history in the making people."

And although there are many plot holes, contradictions, and other bits of carelessness in the filmmaking process, it's still a visually stunning experience -- one that led me to watch it several times. Also, it helps to turn on the DVD's subtitles in order to discern what the heck Saito is saying during several key scenes.I didn't get too hung up on trivial inconsistencies because the movie moves along at a lively pace. To paraphrase Ariadne, it's more about the feel.OK, so if you're in the middle of a dream, and ""an extremely powerful sedative"" is being used, you end up in limbo if you get killed. However, because Yusuf tailored the sedative to leave inner ear function unimpaired, the falling-to-your-death sensation will still wake you up even if you're many layers deep. So why didn't they just drop Saito if they were worried about losing him to limbo? Oh, and if you've never been in limbo before, you automatically end up in the infinite depths of the subconscious world of one of your co-dreamers who might've been there before. In other words, let's just make stuff up and call it good.Nevertheless, ""Inception"" is still a nifty flick with plenty of cool visuals to keep you interested. It's a fun ride."

Even if it borrowed a lot from Matrix, Orphee, even Kane at the climax, and others, it was so confident and assured in the depiction and dissection of its nonsense world I couldn't help but be very impressed. So what if the plot apparently bulges with Real World non sequiteurs and Dream World paradoxes – as recommended to a character in the film (and by Cocteau in Belle Et La Bete) we have to take a leap of faith. It's why so many people believe in a God.A team of mind altering thieves (Extractors) are recruited and hired by a billionaire capitalist to plant an idea via dreams (Inception) in a rival billionaire capitalist's mind to break up his empire and thus preserve profit margins. As you might or might not imagine it's not so straightforward, leading to a dream within a dream within a dream within a dream within a dream and limbo  at least. The acting was good, however the characters were basically 2D and although DeCaprio's was fleshed out a little more I didn't empathise with any of them, but the plot was the thing after all! There's no compromise: it's tortuous to follow at times and relentlessly fast paced throughout – the first 10 minutes were incomprehensible to me but gradually it became as clear as mud, until even I saw the ending coming. My modern-film-savvy daughter was on hand to act as interpreter but we had to lean on each other and promise a re-view next year sometime. I would add that the actual process of putting people under was thankfully skipped over and Michael Caine's usual death-touches were blissfully brief.On first and second thoughts I recommend this as a film made in 2010 that has absolutely no swearing, no sex, not much violence, a ""realistic"" amount of cgi cartoonery, but a well made engrossing storyline instead."

I imagined the directorial staff telling them: ""Hey you, run over here, then turn around that way.....just do it, don't ask why right now!""I don't think DiCaprio was very well cast. He can be intense, but often comes off like a teenager posing as an adult. This role called for someone more eccentric with a mysterious presence. Likewise, the architect girl seemed like she belonged in high school, though she was nice to look at.The plot had a good premise but it barely got me involved psychologically. After the first hour or so, the layers of complexity got ahead of themselves and erased any real feeling of suspense. You need a decent grasp of what's actually going on to feel suspense. Due to the lack of focus, I found my eyes straying to things like the Joliesque bump on the wife's forehead, etc. A good film doesn't let the mind wander.After a point, this thing became so convoluted that I was trying to figure out how it was made (on a technical level) rather than putting serious effort into following the plot. Yes, I got the gist of the dream layers and the general plan, but the timing of the ""kicks"" became too hard to follow.I spent half my viewing time wondering why dreams, which in real life contain random absurdities, could be so precise, down to the timing of bombs. These dreams never seemed like ones I've experienced, so the main premise of the movie was ""kicked"" out the door early on. Technology- wise, it seems highly unlikely that people could share dreams except for random electrical pulses.Maybe it played better in a big theater with the crowd adding to the substantial hype that preceded it. I saw it at home on Blu-ray and it just didn't fire me up. I even considered turning it off twice, but the very end was clever enough to make it worth the slog."

Inception is no exception; the concept presented in inception is very unique and refreshing. And it's not only the idea but how Christopher Nolan has presented it was epitome of direction. Though the story is very complicated and everything is happening in hustle and bustle but still you are glued to your seats. The way movie unrolls it self is immaculate work of A class director. All the cast did justice to their roles. Leonardo DiCaprio was very convincing as guilty stricken husband and desperate father to meet his children again. I had never doubted the capabilities of Leonardo and he didn't disappoint me. Oscar veteran Marion Cotillard was very promising as perplexed wife who was the first victim of inception. I think inception is one of the finest works by Nolan till now.

This movie will keep you guessing until the very end and there is not a single second where you want to look away from this movie.Nolan is not the only one who has reached new heights with this film but also Leonardo DiCaprio. Caprio has been vintage in this movie and his performance was beyond outstanding. Nonetheless, Ellen Page and Joseph Gorden-Levitt have also performed extremely well in their respective roles.

Memento, Insomnia, The Prestige, Batman Begins, The Dark Knight and now Inception.

Instead, we see Leonardo DiCaprio, just as he always is : not bad, not good. Ellen Page, here an actress in limbo. Cilian Murphy, in a character also unexploited. And Marion Cotillard in repeated appearances : love, murder, suicide. All the actors seem to think: ""dont't be harsh, I know I am acting in a silly movie; I just do my best not to show."" Alas! their idea of a nightmare goes to our consciousness (without stealing), and stays. The directing is nonexistent.Too bad, I did not fall asleep on my chair, for maybe I would have woken up from this nightmare. The plot is of no interest : if you accept the stupid premises of those scientific dreams, you guess very quickly who will die and who will survive.

Plot holes are all over the place, nothing is properly explained and it's nothing but philosophical mumbo jumbo. Even the action was boring and unexceptional. I wouldn't even see it again if they paid me to do so (although maybe for enough cash I would).

This story however is extremely hallow and full of unnecessary action for the sake of action. This is pop corn; this is bubble gum. Inception doesn't come close to depths of Memento. This is a very good action/sci-fi movie, but not a great one at that. It was made to sell a lot of tickets and a lot of popcorn, but there is no other reason this film exists much beyond that. To try and pass this off as a deep film is an insult to many filmmakers that came before and are still around now. It's even an insult to Nolan's own Memento. This movie is based around a trick. And maybe it's even a good trick. Maybe it's not? But in the end, it feels like I watched this for the same reason I would do a crossword puzzle or a brain tease-to have an entertaining mental challenge for a brief moment, but this movie doesn't go much beyond that. I didn't care about the characters, if Nolan wanted me to care about these characters he would have spend more time with the characters, gone deeper into the relationship between DiCaprio and his wife, but instead he spent more time with silly mind tricks and mindless gunfights so that you'd spend more on popcorn.

The ""story"" here is the story of a role-playing video game, where you get trapped into deeper and deeper levels without knowing what to expect. As you go, the rules change. This is convenient for the writers, who simply make it all up as they go along. If you liked Matrix, you will like this film. You will probably like Titanic, Avatar, and other films that dangle flashy special effects in front of your eyes.

People always moan about Nolan's movies not being emotional, but this one is definitely not one of them. You will feel for Cobb and Mal. Di Caprio has done a terrific job showing the vulnerabilities and guilt of Cobb. Ellen Page and Joseph Gordon Levitt have given neat performances. Tom Hardy was simply brilliant in the way he handled Eames. Cilian, as usual has done job well. The rest of the cast have done a good job as well. The cinematography by Wally Pfister is one of the best in recent times. Hans Zimmer's music is haunting. Editing by Lee Smith is top notch. But this film truly belongs to Nolan. From the storyline to it's execution, Nolan oozes confidence in every department.

It would be an insult to the genius that is Christopher Nolan. I was bewitched from start to finish, from all possible perspectives be it story, screenplay, camera, music, acting - everything under the sun that is put into making a movie of this brilliance.Dom Cobb is an extractor, a person who owns the ability to penetrate dreams and steal ideas. Hired by a Japanese tycoon, Saito, he assembles a crew with individual capabilities to aid him in the ultimate deception - inception. Inception is planting an idea as opposed to stealing an idea.The first half sets the speed and the concept. In fact the whole of the first part of the movie did what Matrix tried to do in three versions. It was complex, almost utter nonsense but believable and direct.It is in the second half that the complications start and the director explores all possibilities of the ground rules of the concept that he had just lain foundation to. The movie peaks and falls at the right times, with the climax bringing the ultimate reasoning behind it all - which is even more convoluted and has lead to multiple discussions.The one thing that struck me was that, all the actors are stellar ones, starting off with Leonardo Di Caprio, Joseph Gordon Lewitt, Ellen Page, Michael Caine and Marion Cotillard. But the fact remains, the director managed to outshine them all, easily, as if he was doing it in his dream.'Memento', 'Insomnia', 'The Dark Knight' and 'The Following' all seem to be leading up to this movie which has the traditional Nolan checklist of a non-linear narrative, intertwined plots, intelligent dialogues and enough action.A movie that balances entertainment and intelligence with heavy doses of either.

With this he has created a monumental & thoroughly original piece of cinema that not only entertains but makes you think, something that modern blockbusters have failed to do time & time again (e.g. Avatar, Transformers, Clash Of The Titans).Leonardo DiCaprio leads a sublime ensemble cast that includes some of today's biggest & brightest stars and a true legend in Michael Caine, while Leo himself delivers arguably his greatest performance yet.The film looks & feels stunning!! The visuals are top-notch, the film sounds suitably tense while Hanz Zimmer's score only adds to the atmosphere. The script is (as you would expect) brilliant, remaining complex but relatively easy to follow & Nolan has once again stayed clear of conventional narrative to heighten the film's complexities.This is a true original & just goes to show everyone that blockbusters can be intellectually challenging whilst remaining hugely enjoyable. As a result, one can't help but want more from a standout film in a year that surely has more to offer than it has produced thus far. A new dimension of boundary-breaking has just been created by the new Kubrick / Hitchcock of film."

Christopher Nolan personifies the idea that every one of us has experienced at some level in the form of dreams and creates an unprecedented and mind-numbing story. The human mind is so dynamic and creative that when uninhibited can create powerful alternate realities in the form of dreams.This dream draws its details from memories, logic and most importantly ideas that can shape every perceivable outcome. The story hinges on the perception that ideas are resilient parasites which when implanted in the brain, grows indiscriminately like a tumor and can supplant commonly held beliefs and force the dreamer into revealing personal details to the supplanter/extractor called ""Inception"". Leonardo DiCaprio (Cobb) plays the part of a world's best extractor who gets a contract from a powerful executive to perform inception. This is insignificant, as the real story is about Cobb (DiCaprio) and his personal journey into becoming the thief he is now. Everything else that is shown portends the complexity of his past that has been a melting pot of love, hate, loss, regret and anger. In fact at the end of the movie I completely forgot the cast of characters other than DiCaprio and rightly so because of the significance placed on the life of Cobb. Christopher Nolan uses the most compelling images in the form of special effects and a layered, interconnected plot that challenges your mind to think unconventionally. I realized that most of the negative reviews results from a poor understanding of the underlying theme and the inability to make out the fast paced changes that occur in the movie. But it's not that complicated and as described in this review, has very few underlying thematic points. Just sit back and enjoy the mind shattering experience of understanding what dreams are all about."

Inception is one of those mind numbing movies that demand a lot from the viewer and pushes the boundary of imagination. Dealing with dreams and memories is not something new for Hollywood(read matrix, esotsm, what dreams may come, cell etc) but where inception stands out is the brilliance that only Nolan can lend to the story and the execution. The visual effects, the acting, the cinematography, the story telling and more has just keen kicked up a notch! In many of his movies, the characters or say the protagonist is shown with a shortcoming or a secret that he/she needs to overcome and inception is no different! Di Caprio plays Cobb; a thief of a different kind who specializes in entering peoples dreams and extracting secrets. Fate has it that to overcome his fears and get back to his family, he is forced to perform inception, a dangerous process that involves planting new ideas into a subject after entering his/her dream. What follows is a complex and twisted story of dreams within dreams, blurred visions and powerful imagination.It is always important to weave a story no matter how complex around simple realities that are ""more"" human than what the story highlights. Nolan does it by focusing on Cobb and his psychological challenges of dealing with simple emotions like love, guilt and redemption. This is where the story becomes indulgent when we see the director trying hard to keep the audience rooted to the story but not often able to do so. Any artist can only go as far as his imagination takes him and cannot possibly predict the depths that the mind of his audience can reach. Nolan certainly pushes his imagination with Inception and teases his audience to do better. Inception might need more than one viewing to comprehend the hidden nuances but whatever be the case, the movie certainly leaves you grappling with your own dreams and realities. Surely a little self-indulgent but somehow, nobody seems to bother!ps: the movie ends in typical Nolan style but somehow one knows how it ends in ""his"" mind!"

It boasts a star-laden cast: di Caprio, Hardy, Cotillard, Caine, Postlethwaite, and many other greats in small roles. Yet, there is not a single great piece of acting in it.
The script is full of twists, play on the third dimension, time, and all kinds of theories, but in the end... it has no idea how to end. It goes on and on, mostly in slow motion.
What was the secret sought in the vault? Was ""disappointed"" a synonym for CITIZEN KANE's ""Rosebud""?
In a nutshell, that is how pretentious and hollow INCEPTION is.
A waste of talent."

Dom Cobb (Leonardo DiCaprio) is skilled at stealing secrets by diving into your dreams. It's a dark treacherous world where he has made too many enemies. Now he is offered a chance to come in from the cold. This time his team is tasked to plant an idea into the target's mind, or in one word inception.Christopher Nolan has created something of a Penrose-stairs structure in this movie. It's complicated and may be too convoluted to be reasonable. But that's as much part of its charm. The worlds, the effects, the ideas are all first rate. It is oozing with originality.The actors are also first rate. Nolan can command the best cast to his projects now. There is nobody better than DiCaprio to anchor this movie.

The premise is ridiculous on every level and they try to make it seem clever by not explaining anything.The reason trippy things happen when you dream is because the brain is operating at such a low level that simple logic and common sense are not possible. Its not possible to deal with layers of complexity of the dreams within dreams, the visual world itself is well beyond the comprehension of an unconscious brain. Quite simply if your brains awake enough to deal with this world then you are very awake.Though the stupidest part is entering other peoples dreams by lying down next to them....i found that interesting...Even the thing about the chick from Juno being the architect and she wasn't even gonna go in with them. The premise appeared one of them would control/create the world from within the dream world which was meant to be her, yet she wasn't gonna be there...Worst big budget movie I've seen although I just saw Prometheus and that was pretty bad."

I love concept films, and feel cgi can make a movie much more powerful. However, this was one of the worst movies I have seen in a long time.First, there is zero character development. The lead role is a waste of DiCaprio's sizable talent.Second, the concept is not actually that interesting. There are many, many movies with much lower budgets that actually present the concept in a much more powerful and important way - such as _Scanners_.Third, the cgi is pathetically overdone. The cinematographers seem to expect the viewer to be overwhelmed by sheer scale, rather than use cgi to enhance a well-shot, well-scripted, well-conceived film. For an example of cgi used well, see _Pan's Labyrinth_ or _Attack the Block._ Most people will respond to sheer scale, but for viewers who love great films, this movie is bound to disappoint.I walked out of the movie and thought, ""so what?"" Then I thought, ""I just wasted $8.50, that's what."""

It even made me forget that Leonardo DiCaprio was in it. I was a little suspect when I saw a movie with Leonardo DiCaprio and Joseph Gordon-Levitt as the 2 top billed stars. Joseph Gordon-Levitt is a decent actor but his career up until this movie was somewhat relegated to small budget B movies. As for DiCaprio, It is my opinion that he is a highly overrated, overacting actor at best. Some how director Christopher Nolan was able to harness these 2 back enough to make for an outstanding movie that has become one of my new favorites.The story is about Cobb (DiCaprio) and his team. They are assembled to enter peoples dream's in order to steal important information from high profile corporate targets. After running into a problem, Di Caprio has to get himself and his team out of trouble by performing a task thought impossible, actually implant an idea within a dream in someones head, that will cause the person to act out that complex task in the real conscience world, inception.Can they do it, or will personal past demons trap them in a nightmare of their own doing.The strength of this movie is that so much of it takes place within the dream world that it doesn't really have to follow any real rules. A set can be anything in which the filmmakers wants it to be. To pull that off though everything has to be visually stunning, and it is. ""The Cell"" came close, and the old Dennis Quaid, ""Dreamscape"" was great in its day, but this one blows them out of the water.The acting was great, and as I said before, I am not a Dicaprio fan. Ellen Paige plays ""The Architect,"" Ariadne, which if you have ever read Greek Mythology you will understand the nod given there, and she is good as tool to open up the movie to Cobbs past demons.Everything in this movie is absolutely on point and is a rare case where it all comes together in every facet. This is one of those movies that leaves you sitting in the theater after the credits not wanting to believe its over and that you now have to go on with your drab, boring life. That is a rarity these days.Like my reviews, Hate em? Comments, Hate mail, or do you have a specific DVD you want me to review? Shoot me an e-mail at: subliminal.lithium@gmail.com"
406,497,0.008223064,0.28562123,0.70615584,10,Inception,"In Inception, we are taken on a deep and highly illustrated exploration into the field of technologically assisted lucid dreaming, dream communication, and the subconscious mind. After seeing this movie for the first time in the theaters, I have seen it two more times, and with every subsequent viewing, I have been able to understand the concepts even more. Throughout the movie there is talk of a technique named ""inception"" which can be used to implant messages into certain people's subconscious mind during a certain stage of sleep, hence the tittle of the movie. A fascinating aspect of this movie is the premise of a person being able to communicate with another person while both of them are in a dreaming state of consciousness. On top of that this film explores the different varying levels of dream states and how factors in the physical environment outside of the dreamer translate into factors in the dreamer's lucid dream or subconscious. After doing personal research on the topic of lucid dreaming & the inception of lucid dreams, I have found out that there ACTUALLY ARE a variety of technological instruments which have been developed which are capable of achieving some of the results(or results similar to those) which were achieved in the movie. Thus, Inception is not a total work of fiction or science fiction, but also a reference to what can be and/or is possible to an extent with technology that is currently available or which may be available sometime in the near future. As a person particularly interested in the fields of Parapsychology, Dreamwork, & Psychology, Inception is no doubt a classic production in my eyes."

Very special and well done Nolan, Caprio and all actors and technicians involved in this motion picture.Leave aside the concept of Inception - Getting an idea to be planted in somebody's mind- idea of extraction,is no normal mind movie goer would have been treated with. Its amazing to see how well its done here. I consider its the best work i had seen from west. Its not a movie, I would call it a dream come true - cant give a name for it. ""Inception"" is that type of movies that keep you on edge, thinking, wondering about the movie subject, imagining , dreaming and talking about it for days.I would wait and see Inception becoming best movie ever overtaking Godfather and Shawshank's. 11 out of 10 from me. Cheers..happy watching. And oh forget to ask its makers- ANY IDEA ABOUT PREQUEL OR SEQUEL TO THIS????????????????"
408,499,0.26209605,0.39119452,0.3467094,10,You'll wonder how you ever doubted this movie.,"When I first saw trailers for Inception a couple of years back when it first came out, I shrugged. It looked really mediocre, another one of ""those"" films Hollywood churns out every now and then trying to spin off the success of the Matrix films and isn't half as clever as it thinks, ending up a waste of a big budget. But recently noticing the reams of five-star reviews from hundreds of critics, I decided to check it out. And I was so very, very wrong.The whole concept is very mind-bending, almost impossible to get your mind around. It pushes the very limits of your intellect into trying to understand this riddle of a movie, and, as it goes along, it feels like everything falls into place, like every question is answered and as a result, in the end you do not feel cheated but satisfied and enriched. What's more incomprehensible than the story itself is how Christopher Nolan came up with the story, put it to paper and ended up with an almost flawless script, and then created a film almost impossible to imagine in the first place.Of course, it's not perfect. Not every single second captivates you like with some films, but it certainly is great enough for ten-out-of-ten. The score is fantastic, one of the best I've heard for a long time, and it really helps you engage with the film.It really leaves you wondering. You won't stop thinking about it for a long time as it has challenged your intellect so far. It may not be quite on the same level as 'The Matrix', or quite as thrilling as Nolan's earlier hit 'The Dark Knight', but its intelligence surpasses any film I've seen in my life, and that is why I can give 'Inception' an honest ten-out-of-ten."
