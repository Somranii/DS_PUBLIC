""The Matrix"" looked exciting enough in the trailers, so I decided to give it a look.  What I found was an amazing movie, with some of the greatest special effects I've ever seen.  The camera angles really work for the action sequences and the choreographed fight scenes made me yearn for more.  Say what you want about Keanu Reeves' acting.  He may not deliver the best dialogue, but his look can carry a film.  He was a great choice for the role of Neo.  Carrie Anne Moss was great as was the underrated Laurence Fishburne.  I highly recommend this film for those who are a fan of visually stunning movies.  It will blow away your senses..."
1,3,0.003712268,0.04974957,0.94653815,10,Raises the bar for sci-fi films for years to come,"The Wachowski Brothers vision of a possible future takes the visual and sound aspects of filmmaking to a new high. Incorporating older still photography with computer enhancement to the degree that appears on the screen has raised the genre to a level that will be very hard-pressed by filmmakers for a number of years. Acting was wonderful, script, visual, sound, everything about this film is a tribute to a usually overlooked genre."
2,4,0.014025281,0.08134906,0.90462565,10,"The more you watch it, the better it gets","The Wachowski brothers really did excel themselves with this movie. It's a brilliant movie on a number of different levels - the directing is excellent, the camera work is great, the visuals are stunning, the kung-fu is A+, acting is executed with style and conviction, and the plot is truly inspired. It's really hard to use enough superlatives on this movie!It'd be a 10/10, except for the ending. Having Neo do what he does at the end really lets it down, in my opinion. However, there's a couple of sequels on the way, so let's see what the Wachowskis can do to make up for it.Other than that, (and like I said above) the movie is operating on so many different levels that each time you watch it, you pick up something new... this isn't by accident, either. The Wachowski brothers had the actors read a number of definitive works (Simulation & Simulcra was one I believe) in modern literature and psychology, and applied liberal dashings of aspects of the major religions to provide the best sci-fi movie of the decade, if not ever.I'm yet to meet somebody who hasn't enjoyed it. It's my favourite movie to watch on a good cinema system, too."
3,5,0.028026909,0.17435859,0.7976145,8,Guns. Leather. Keanu Reeves. How cool can it get?,"You walk into this film not knowing what the Matrix is. You take your seat and watch the trailers. The green Warner Brothers (green? you ask) trademark comes up, and without warning you are thrust into the Wachowski brothers grand vision. 2 hours of excitement later, you stumble out of the cinema, knowing what the Matrix is.This is one great movie. Keanu Reeves is cooler than cool as Neo. The Wachowski brothers skilful direction is brilliant. The special effects sequences will blow you away, did I mention the government lobby scene?The film starts off with a 'what is real?' first half, and then the first kung-fu sequence makes way for an action- packed, John Woo-esque second half with slomo and style cranked up all the way to the top. Did I mention the government lobby scene?Keanu becomes Cool Keanu, Carrie-Anne Moss is a real find and Hugo Weaving is perfect in his against typecasting role as the evil Agent Smith.You may notice in this review that I have not revealed what the Matrix is. Like the trailer says, 'You have to see it for yourself.'Excellent. Best film of '99. 9/10."
4,6,0.08077595,0.61254096,0.306683,9,The Matrix has Buddhist themes,"A large part of the appeal of 'The Matrix' for me was the special effects and action-packed scenes. But, on reflection, part of the appeal is also its philosophical and religious underpinnings...When asked whether Buddhist ideas influenced them, the Wachowski brothers offered an unqualified ""Yes!"" and at a very basic level, the movie portrays two levels of reality: our everyday existence and a deeper, more significant, underlying reality (the matrix). This is very much like the Two Truths in Buddhism: relative truth, in which everything is perception, and ultimate truth which is the way things really are (objective reality). Because of our ignorance, we mistake the everyday world for something real and objective, and this is the cause of our suffering. As in 'The Matrix', breaking through relative truth to direct contact with ultimate truth represents a high spiritual attainment, some would say enlightenment, an awakening. (Remember the message on Neo's computer screen: ""Wake up, Neo!"")Mahayana Buddhism suggests that there are great spiritual warriors (like Neo?) who are walking the path from ignorance to enlightenment, and who can in turn guide us on the path."

I love this film, and rate it a notch above some of the other great action films of our time (i.e., Terminator, Predator) because it has a really well thought out (although moderately unbelievable) story line.  A lot of thought provoking material, and some interesting subtleties. I've seen it 10 times (I don't usually watch a movie more than once), and I'll watch it a few more. Enjoy!"

There, I've said it. To question the realness of reality is a 400-year old Cartesian idea. Actually, it was explored more interestingly in the old Star Trek episode ""Spectre of the Gun"" in 1969. The rest of the film is an obvious rip-off of ""The Terminator"" and all of John Woo, which are far more interesting movies. The film ponders too long on the central premise, and there isn't enough action to make it a good action movie, either. Still, overall production design is great, but the acting is wooden, and Fishburne makes for an unconvincing guru. All the good scenes were revealed in the trailer, so there's not much else to do than just sit in the theatre and feel patronized by the whole thing. At least, that's what I did. The whole thing just isn't half as clever and original as it wants to be."

It not only looks better than mainstream movies today, you're hard pressed to tell what was added in visual effects and what was happening at the time of the shoot.The entire tower scene, not just the bottom level, is a thing of beauty. From all of the rain and explosions and bits flying around that you can see clearly now in 4K, to the generated explosion when the bomb hits the basement. Just gorgeous. Give it a watch, or a rewatch. It's worth it even now more than ever."

Ooh look at all our fancy camera tricks and weapons and weird sci-fi stuff that really makes no sense. But it's loud!  And that makes a good film, you know.  And I would love, just once in my life, to see Keanu Reeves not play a blank-faced doofus in every movie he's made since ""Bill and Ted.""In short, I absolutely and totally hated this film.  My fiance loves it and watches it at least once a month, but I would rather clean out a cat box every hour for the rest of my life than ever see this film again."

So we left and he sat through it a second time. This movie is splendidly done. The mystery about what the Matrix is, unravels and you see a dystopian future unlike any we as a race would want. I have watched this over and over and never tire of it. Everyone does a great job acting in this, the special effects are above par and the story is engaging."

Or so I thought.The Matrix combined the best of hard science-fiction with Asian cinema's frenetic and masterfully choreographed action sequences, gorgeous direction, pitch-perfect casting, and the best martial arts I'd ever seen in a Hollywood film.I don't think the sequels did it justice, but The Matrix - as a stand-alone film - remains one of my all time favorites in ANY genre."

My girlfriend and I would have left the cinema half-way through if we knew that we both felt the same about it at the time! Apart from the special effects, the film suffers from WOODEN ACTING (There goes Keanu again!) and ridiculous storyline. The special fx are amazing though - apart from that it is a total waste of time. However - we seem to stand alone on this one, as the rest of the world seems to think this is the most amazing film ever made. Oh well."
12,16,0.10450064,0.44961652,0.44588292,1,A good video game commercial disguised as a terrible movie,"I'm not sure why so many people were so impressed by this movie.  Story? Perhaps if you've never thought about realistic virtual reality, or dreamed you were a butterfly and wondered if you were a butterfly dreaming you were a man.  Then you might be blinded to the huge plot holes. But the script will fit wonderfully to its obvious destination: a video game surely on its way to stores right now.Perhaps the action sequences, if you're the type who likes violence video games so much you'd be happy to sit and watch someone else play one... over and over and over.  The camera tricks and effects were interesting once, but we've all seen them on TV already -- the commercial, in fact, is better than the movie.Certainly it wasn't the characters.  Only Morpheus had any kind of personality, which saved us from having to find out what the other actors might have been like if they'd been called on to act.  Keanu got two scenes that required acting (the kiss of life, and the epiphany), but he missed on both and just laid or stood there.  The rest of the movie, Neo was called The One, but he might have been The Zero -- other than a token reference to him having the trouble with authority figures all action heros are required by Hollywood Law to have (subtlely portrayed by having someone tell him ""you have trouble with authority figures, don't you?"") he had no character, making Keanu a great fit for him.William Gibson, save us!"

You get ""The Matrix""I hate this movie...and you wanna know why?  Because it serves no purpose. It's ""Dude, Where's my Car"" on steroids...louder, flashier, but not a bit more interesting.  The whole thing is based on special effects.  It's a film by two directors that think half of the cameras running at 300 fps is art...or something.Hugo Weaving has the only good performance in this movie as Agent Smith. Carrie Anne Moss is bland as can be.  Do I even have to comment on Keanu Reeves....dude...woah...nuff said.This is the perfect example of Joel Silver run amuck.  Just because you have money to produce movies, doesn't mean you should produce bad movies....sounds pretty obvious to me.  I'm just so thankful when I see someone like Steven Spielberg putting out a movie like Minority Report...a movie (actually...a director and crew) that knows how to USE special effects to drive a story.  Not just shoot the hell out of a government building...hmmmm...not such a great scene to slip in there now, huh?So, to everyone involved in The Matrix...give up your black leather, gun toting, world-is-an-illusion, horrible filmmaking and go put your money to good use...like film school."

Iconic scenes are still having benchmarks setting up.If we say it sci-fi at its best, it won't be wrong. The hype was real, it is still not easy to match the level of Matrix where we experience the connection of humans and science, that too with amazing action fight and chase scenes, not just normal scenes they were, multiple exposures, slow motion 3D moves, Oh My God, and it's understandable as well like what are the characters up to and what storyline they are entering into. The script was very well written and executed otherwise it could have been a mess. A special appreciation in managing the theme with those black color costumes and a scientific zone with unimaginable equipment and props doing unbelievable things in the two worlds created. No spoilers, but the action scenes in the climax where the protagonist goes to save someone from agents are really breathtaking. The technology used at its best.A salute to Wachowski Brothers and the team for creating this masterpiece. It will be a great competition and motivation as well for many films coming in the future."

16,20,0.60136926,0.32136872,0.07726189,1,"I Can't Tell You How Bad ""The Matrix""- but I'll try.","I made every effort to be open minded about ""The Matrix."" I put aside such questions as ""Why does Hollywood see Keanu as a cyberpunk? How came everyone is making making a big deal about these fx which you can see in shampoo commercials?"" I can honestly say I gave it every chance. The fact that the creators were trying to create fully developed worldview was admirable, and the movies surprises hadn't yet been revealed.So as the movie rolled, and I got too see one of the worst, most painful movies I have ever seen, I could honestly say it wasn't me. I enjoy scifi and Hong Kong films, enjoy Philip K. Dick, so I was basically the ideal audience for this film.The plot was so full of loopholes, maintaining suspension of disbelief was impossible. Except for one or two supporting cast members, the acting was lifeless, and the action was unsupported by any motivation. The antagonists were far more sympathetic than the protagonists, whose cold-blooded killing sprees did nothing to endear them to me. Finally the washed out lighting and coloring took away a lot of depth from the images.. when someone seems to leap from building to building, if the buildings look collapsed together, it's not that impressive.
And the fighting.. when you watch Jet Li or Jackie Chan fight, even when they are obviously assisted by wires, you feel an exhilaration at what they are physically capable of doing. The fights flow, and the character is maintained through out. In The Matirx, there is no real joy or sense of exertion. People punch each other, pull some interesting feats, but without any sense of risk or accomplishment.What people saw in this waste of film, time and money, I do not know. But I include it with the American remake of Godzilla as one of the worst movies I have ever seen. If you want Phillip K. Dick reality warping, see Blade Runner. If you want good cyberpunk anime, see Akira or Ghost in The Shell, or for martial arts, a good Bruce Lee or Hong Kong flick.But don't waste your time on this."
17,21,0.31365398,0.51468927,0.17165679,1,Psudo intellectual dribble...,"I know that this is one of the most popular movies of all time, but that is a flaw in the viewing public. The main reason I dislike this movie so much is because it was a rip off of a much better movie that came out a couple years before it. That being Dark City. Lets review the similarities shall we? First of all our main character wakes up disoriented and not understanding the world around him JM because he lost his memory and Neo because he is taken out of the matrix. We find that both characters have been given a false set of memories by puppeteers (be them aliens or robots) We find that these puppeteers are doing the same thing for all people in an attempt to keep their own race going (matrix as batteries DC cus they need to find the soul) Finally the main character proves to be the savior of the humans by finding they are the only one who can put an end to the false lives that the puppeteers are forcing humans to live. they both do this through the same method. by having a mentor teach them how to use the devices of their captors against them (neo learns how to hack and control the matrix while Murdoc learns how to use the machines of the strangers to alter reality. also we see stylish black leather as the main wardrobe in the matrix. black leather gowns are the main wardrobe for the strangers. moving away from the rip off problem we see that Dark City has a message implying you to ask yourself if your identity is more than just the sum of your memories. the matrix makes people feel smart for understanding the movie, but really offers no deep thought. the feel of Dark City is also better since it has the dark ambiance created by the same director as The Crow. while the matrix has nothing new or special about its ""feel"" just your basic action movie with a plot to try to make the viewer feel smart. Point is: same movie only better (although lacking the eye candy the public adores) is Dark City"

The Joy Luck Club figured prominently in the course. I like the idea of combining movies and theory.I am now studying metaphysics, and any study of reality begins with René Descartes, the father of modern philosophy. Descartes began his intellectual odyssey with this question: How do we know that there is a reality outside our own minds? We each know that we have experiences, and we can be sure of these experiences; therefore, each of us can be sure that we exist. But how do we know that the internal experiences we have corresponds to objects outside our minds?This is the whole theme of The Matrix. Watching this film is like studying metaphysics."

Yes, it had great cinematography and effects, yes it had a great soundtrack but NO WAY was the acting superb and NO WAY was the storyline great.Take that storyline and stick it in any other action movie and you would leave feeling disappointed at the end. It's major selling point was ""What is the Matrix? You have to see it for yourself."" Come on, the only plot twist was that thing to do with Cypher, and that wasn't greatly unforeseeable, there's things like that in every frigging action movie.The thing that set it apart was the ground-breaking camera effects, gnarly special effects and a funky soundtrack, as well as the costume design bit, with all that leather and expensive sunglasses. Without this stuff, all you would be left with is your average action movie.I'm not saying it was a bad film at all, just not one of the greatest.

As a matter of fact, the producers of this thing probably owe its popularity to parents who dumped their kids in video parlors at malls instead of sending them to school.I mean, even if you get past the impressive (for awhile, anyway) whistles and buzzers, ""The Matrix"" pushes the envelope just an inch too far when it asks us to believe Keanu Reeves' MIND is being sought to SAVE THE WORLD! It's too funny for words. WHO could believe it?Well, I guess if you have never met anyone who actually HAD a mind you MIGHT buy it.

23,28,0.023022788,0.08032123,0.89665604,10,One of the best movies ever! (This review is only about the original Matrix movie),"The Matrix is one of the best sci-fi movies ever made!I read it used to be one of Tarantino's favourite ones too, but the second and third ones ruined the whole beautiful idea and brought the overall value of the movie pretty low.The story/philosophy is mind-blowing and the directing, special effects and the overall performance absolutely amazing. Thomas Anderson (Keanu Reeves) is an IT specialist in his day-to-day job and a hacker (alias Neo) during the night. He is looking for Morpheous (Lawrence Fishburn) who could give him the answer to the question 'What is the Matrix?' The more relevant questions to ask, though, would be ""How would you know the difference between the dream world and the real world?"" and ""How would you know if what is happening right now is not a virtual reality?""The antagonist, Agent Smith (Hugo Weaving), is one of my favourite characters. Just watch his mouth - the way he speaks, the tone and pitch of his voice, his pronunciation, even the pauses he makes while speaking, have an incredible effect on the viewer. The concept of people being like cancer to this world is absolutely astounding.Carrie Ann Moss was the perfect choice for Trinity because any other blond, big lipped, big brested 'bimbo' would have totally ruined her character.A few more questions pop up in one's mind. ""Haven't we gone too far creating such super intelligent machines?"", ""What if they become so powerfull one day and take control over humanity?""The acting's just amazing, all of them, no exceptions. The 4 leading characters though... (Morphy, Trinity, Neo & Agent Smith) - (yes, to me there are 4 leads) - I love them all. I can't imagine the movie with any other 4 actors but L. Fishbourn, C.A. Moss, Keanu and H. Weaving. They were born to play those roles.Whoever did the casting did a terrific job. Bravo!Brilliant, absolutely brilliant!"

On its own merits, it deserves more than the one star I gave it, but when you factor in the annoyance factor of the gushing fans... well, let's say I just felt a need to counterbalance its high ratings.Blah, blah, blah, special effects. So what. Yet another example of Special-Effects-In-Search-Of-A-Movie. The story holds together poorly. The premise was initially pretty interesting, but the movie seemed utterly incapable of establishing rules for how its world works and sticking to them.Finally, the movie hit a pet peeve of mine, which was, to me, its ultimate, fatal flaw. I'm very big on the ""science"" part of ""science fiction"". So you lose me instantaneously when you start introducing mystic mumbo-jumbo into a science fiction story. For me, this film jumped the shark when we get to that wise woman character. (nevermind that the mystic nonsense is somewhat demystified in the sequel films; this review is about *this* film). Yeah, dropping in an all-knowing, cryptic prophetess, without the tiniest hint of explanation of her abilities, makes for a convenient plot device, but defies all reason or sense."

Plenty of neat special effects to distract the audience from the flawed and empty re-telling of the age old ""what is reality"" story. A few interesting bible references, great blue-screening (better than Episode 1 by far), but with stone-like acting from every cast member, everyone ends up looking like part of the machine. If you want to see a movie that really deals with the issue ""what is reality"" see Darren Aronofsky's ""Pi"" (1998).

The camera shots were bizarre, too much was left unexplained.  All in all a very poorly executed idea."
27,32,0.009267584,0.041910402,0.948822,9,One of my favorites,"At first, I wasn't interested in seeing the Matrix. But after hardly hearing any bad reviews for it (and believe me, I hear bad reviews for every movie I enjoy) I decided to give it a try. At first, although I really loved the fights, graphics and characters, the plot confused me. (Anyone confused by the plot at all should go to www.knowthematrix.com and you'll find out everything you could want to know) By the second time I watched it, I really understood it, which made the movie even more enjoyable.I really loved this movie. Just about every character, good or bad, is very interesting and cool. The acting was excellent. Even though I think this was Keanu Reeves at his best, the best acting jobs were done by Laurence Fishburne (Morpheus) and Carrie-Anne Moss (Trinity). Hugo Weaving did an excellent job as Agent Smith and Joe Pantoliano was great as Cypher as well.The plot is one of the best movie plots I've seen in a movie. An accountant by day, computer hacker by night guy suddenly finds out that reality as we know it is fake and that we are actually in a giant computer program run by robots (that we created, of course) in order for them to get power. Not only that, but he finds out that he is one who is, according to prophecy, going to put an end to it. The greatest thing is that you learn things just as Neo does, so you can really relate to his character.My favorite thing about this movie is that no matter how many times you watch it, you will learn more about it. I guarantee this. Some may not like this movie because the plot is too complicated, but I recommend that anyone who enjoys movies should go buy this one right away."

I remember being absolutely stunned at the revelation of the plot , but  when I saw it for a second time at the weekend on channel 5 ( First time I saw it was about three years ago ) I was slightly bored by the film . It`s by no means a boring film , it`s just that once you know how the plot twists , turns and sometimes boggles the mind the revelations don`t have the same effect second time around . THE MATRIX hasn`t been helped either by the amount of spoofs/rip offs featuring the scenes where the action stops , the frame freezes , the camera turns 360 degrees and then the action starts again . These scenes were jaw dropping at the time but have now been done by countless ads , pop videos and other movies it`s become impossible now to remember the impact this cinematography technique had at the time . I also think the producers of THE MATRIX haven`t done themselves any favours by turning THE MATRIX into a franchise To sum up this is a good film . Like me you`ll certainly enjoy it first time you watch it but unlike say MEMENTO ( Note the cast connections between the two movies ? ) THE MATRIX doesn`t reward the audience with repeat viewings and at the end of the day the not too dissimilar TOTAL RECALL is probably a more enjoyable film"

Unfortunately, the special effects were the only things stunning about the movie, unless you count how stunningly stupid the dialogue was, or how stunningly bad the acting was (even good actors like Fishbourne and Joe Pantalione couldn't get anything out of this script).  The filmakers here took a wonderful concept, filled it with marvelous special effects and left it to die without any substance.  If it's enough for you for a movie to look good, then you'll love this film.  If, like me, you need an interesting story, good dialogue and acting, don't bother with The Matrix."

Sorry, brothers Wachowski, have a look at the Fassbinder movie again and learn that less is more. Some people like this kind of action; for me it ruins a movie completely. I was still a kid when I saw that Fassbinder movie, and I would like to see it again; but their are some legal problems about the rights to this movie, and it can't be broadcast at the moment."

This ended up not being that huge a problem for me because everything else is so well executed.Particularly striking about 'The Matrix' is its production values. Simply put, the film looks amazing in its audacious production design, dazzling special effects that are some of the most ultra-cool and imaginative to exist, super slick editing and often jaw dropping cinematography. So much more than a film with ground-breaking special effects and use of camera work that broke boundaries.Use of sound was also striking, and how the pulsating and hypnotic music score was used. Andy and Larry Wachowski direct adeptly, while the script is an intelligent mix of complex and well-explored themes, mysticism, philosophy and even Lewis Carroll and the story is often invigorating and intensely taut with a smart concept brilliantly done.Action is superbly shot and edited, and the way it is choreographed is relentlessly intense and breathless in its energy, Kung Fu has rarely been more vertigo-inducing (despite how this sounds, this is not a bad thing as it added hugely to the intensity and paranoia of the story's atmosphere) on film.Keanu Reeves is in one of his best and most iconic roles and has never looked cooler, certainly has not looked this comfortable for a while before then. Carrie Anne Moss is strong. Even better are an imposingly charismatic Laurence Fishburne (also in one of his best roles), an amusing Joe Pantoliano and a deliciously wicked Hugo Weaving.Summing up, not one of the best of the genre but a mile-stone nonetheless and a great one.

What did I forget ? Yes, some indirect advertising of a famous cellular telephone producer (the kind used is so particular .), perhaps not so common in 2199 (when is supposed to be the story), a software house where your chief tells you will be fired if arriving late working (while it is known that usually software houses are opened nearly 24 hours a day).

The framing plot, when revealed, requires more than just a willing suspension of disbelief, it requires that you dismantle all your critical faculties and just content yourself with wallowing in the faintly entertaining special effects.It tries to be cool - and evidently succeeds in the eyes of many of the people who see it - but it seems to me little more than another soulless product of committee thinking and appeals to the lowest common denominator - and it doesn't get much lower than this.If you wish to see the same ground covered with more intelligence and visual flare, try the better-than-average film 'Dark City' (also mentioned by another reviewer) or the less accessible, but more stylish 'eXistenZ'.

Well, some get up and leave the theater. Others wait for the action scenes and the CGI display. Then again, these scenes make no sense either. As time goes by they become longer and longer. Endless fist fighting in scenes where everyone seems almost indestructible. Why do I care that a character is being thrown at the wall if I know it won't hurt him? And why do they use fists? Why not detonate a bomb? Who knows... And who cares?The sequels, however, get even worse.

In reality, those hopes collapsed in face of this movie. I have to confess that it is absolutely awful. Nothing more and nothing less. The dialogs are sprinkled with a myriad of pseudo-philosophic sentences, which are intended to awake in us deep thoughts. Well, it didn't arouse anything in me but boredom. I do not accept that Morphius has some kind of deep perspective on life and I do not accept Neo's battle with himself as representing something in our lives. The movie has engaged in a circle of happenings which do not take us anywhere. All the passes between the real world and the Matrix world are so casual and unsophisticated, that it puzzled me. I do not understand why did the producers of this movie bother with so many transitions between the worlds, when nothing really happens, and the basic difference between the worlds is always maintained. Lastly, I was deeply disappointed in the special effects. They are so simplistic and so few that I wonder whether this film should even be classified as a modern sci-fi.  My final conclusion would be that this movie has become some kind of culture item, and people were grasped by its media-magic. Two years after its release, it's so vane.

That was especially true for the four main characters.Nonetheless, because of the stylish visuals and effects, it entertained.

In fact, it's not really a trilogy, in an organic sense, it's just a movie and its sequels.Anyway, ""The Matrix"" is a film with good premises, but bad developments. Although most of the ideas of the film were taken from sci-fi writers of the 60's and philosophers of the past (the idea that we exist as a thought, or a dream, goes back to Plato at least), the script did a good job in putting these ideas together in a modern plot (at least as for year 2000). The oniric influence of recent sci-fi comic books on the film is visible throughout and is what makes the visual appeal of the film.Unfortunately, what could have been a really good movie has been turned by the W. brothers into an average action flick targetted at 15 year-old boys, among which must belong the guys who wrote this flick is the ""best movie"" they've seen. There is almost no acting, and the heros wearing sunglasses all the time is a good way to avoid any sort of emotion to show on their faces. This total absence of emotion is one of the reasons why nobody gives a f..k whether or not everyone dies in the sequels.The W. brothers have a strong tendency to show off : heroes wearing sunglasses and Armani black leather coats designed for yuppies, trendy night-club population, ""bullet time"" special FX, (ugly) kung fu video game action, heavy metal and techno music during the whole film, etc. All this is supposed to make the film look ""kewwwwl"". In opposition to the heros, the agent Smith wears a dark working suit : he is not cool (although he also wears sunglasses, but that's because he is a spy agent).But what really turns me off is the pretense of the religioso-philosophico-technobabble which hardly hides the vacuity of the characters and the serious weaknesses of the script. There are so many other films which say much more with less, that this film looks highly overblown in comparison.I'm not even trying to elaborate on the sequels, which, instead of correcting these problems, show them in their full splendor.In a word, this flick is highly overrated.

Neo chooses truth and soon wakes in a gel-filled pod in a techno-hell future. His body, and billions of others, is nothing more than a battery to power the machines that rule the future (exactly what they do with this world that they now rule is not explored).Convinced that Neo is 'The One', Morpheous trains him to be deadly digital warrior, but this set-up doesn't go beyond fighting a sentient program called Agent Smith. The war against the machines comes later.There's no denying that the film, unfortunately, was massively influential for virtually every action film that followed. Gone was the 'Die Hard' formula where action was gritty, somewhat realistic, and with practical stuntwork. In it's place they all went for excessive CGI, green-tinted photography, impossible cameras, and impossible physics. The Matrix is semi-stylish with it, but it doesn't ever entertain or excite me.It's the style of the Matrix that's more fondly cherished than the story.

For instance- I know this is nit picking- but how can Cypher be betraying the crew when not only do they have to plug him into the matrix for him to go and meet the agents in the first instance, but are also monitoring said conversation.Secondly- the philosophical parts. The matrix basically asks the question is it better to live the dream. The flaw comes in that in this case it is quite clearly better- great, so mankind is not ""free"" but each person lives a sufficiently realistic existence inside their own head for it not to matter. If the alternative is living in fear and squalor, dodging sentinels whilst eating what looks like congealed semen then I would frankly rather live inside my own dreams dining on fine food etc.Next up, the acting. Could someone please explain to me how Keanu Reeves is a leading man. He single handedly trashes all the good work put in by the supporting cast- especially Laurence Fishburne and Hugo Weaving. Anyway how can I be expected to take a film seriously where Keanu is effectively god?Overall, a reasonable film but not the second coming of Christ so many people think it is."

But what did I expect.This movie is typical of the garbage Hollywood churns out, and how typical of the blind masses to eat it all up. There are massive plot loopholes one could drive a truck through (Someone please explain to me, when in this ""virtual world"", why do they need a phone to get out? That's like saying ""Quick, we need to touch a dog to get out of the matrix!)I have never once in my life seen so many good looking computer geeks. All so stylishly dressed as well, but then again, this is a definite ""style over content"" movie, with black clothes being so popular, it's no wonder the producer wanted people decked out head to toe in trenchcoats. After all, why bother to write a decent storyline when you can just fake it, put in lots of ""great"" special effects, trendy costumes, ""l33t computer H@xors"" and have it sell on these points alone? Sorry, not good enough for me.This movie is plain bad, from the moment it starts right up to the moment it ends, with all the blatant overacting inbetween.If you are one of those people that doesn't like to think when they watch a movie, (and no people, that whole ""Oh the Matrix makes you WONDER"" line is just lame, stop it) you'll love this.

Some people they make fun of the idea that one day humans will be in direct war with machines but those people have not read yet about the Nano technology. The latter technology offers something like the software which teaches Neo how to fight in little time. Well through Nano, they will be able to plant a brainlike chip which works 10,000 times faster than our brain and they are now trying to optimize the speed limit in a way that doesn't endanger our brain which might be burnt working under such speed.As for the flying part, it is very possible if the science of Psychokinesis is given more consideration and in the near future I reckon they will with the evolution of human body which is going toward less and less movement. Has anyone seen the prototype of the new cars which have no pedals and we use sticks to drive and direct the car in different directions.Well, I guess the movie has tackled all these scientific aspects alongside psychological and philosophical ones in a very brilliant way and I 100% give this move 20 on a scale out of 10!"

Lawrence Fishburn gives the worst performance of his career, but he gets praised for it. the wakouski brothers claim themselves as original, but the film easily ripped off John Woo films and Blade Runner.The worst thing about this is, is that everyone's IQ dropped ten points after watching this load of garbage.

Where in the world did they find actors so badly on par with Keanu Reeves? Amongst the 'pretty boy' actors in Hollywood, he is the prince of the wood face. Clint Eastwood may have more expression. All of the actors, with the possible exception of Larry Fishburn, who I have seen in other roles that were good, are as stiff as a corpse. None of Neo's pals need to be in this film. They are totally uninteresting and unnecessary. Apoc? Switch? Mouse? Why? These people have the personalities of a smock. At least the two brothers serve the purpose of getting them in and out of the Matrix and driving the ship. The others are there to look good, and they missed on that too.And why so much needless violence? All these 'cops' they kill are just people suppossedly stuck in that gooey jell you get out of the 25 cent vending machines, right? So, Neo and his babe go around and kill a bunch of helpless, innocent people. Those guys were just minding their own biz when they burst in with an arsenal that rivals that of Rick James's.
And then there are the scary characters. They range from the emotionless 'smiths' to that of those creepy kids who bent spoons and made me wax sentimental about unicef for some reason. In fact, the Smiths were the best 'acted' roles, but I think that's because they had the least to stretch since they were the bad guys.
I can't even get into the plot holes, since there is a word limit, but there were a lot. This whole movie is beyond improbable. But, it's worth a viewing or 2. Check it out if you got a friend who wants to blow there money one saturday night."

It's a premise that only exists in storytelling, and it's a pretty timeworn metaphor. The Matrix is just professional wrestling in high gloss. The 'philosophy' is just psycho-babble gobbldegook meant to confuse, and (I guess) when certain members of the audience are confused, they seem to think they must be in the presence of something beyond their ability to comprehend, and so it must be 'philosophy'. and therefore 'profound'...kind of like aboriginal tribesmen seeing an airplane and thinking it's amazing, something more than they can comprehend.

Now, most people think this film is intelligent, but I thought that is was incredibly long and was almost entirely plotless. It's a shame at how the characters act so serious that you don't know what they are talking about. Another problem I have with the Matrix were the incredibly overrated effects. First of all, I can't understand why the Matrix won the Visual Effects Oscar over the Phantom Menace, which took much more effort and used much more technology. I see so many unoriginalities with the Matrix's effects. People who think that the Bullet Time effects were original and told the story, you obviously haven't seen the slow-motion bullets in Face/Off, which I personally found more eye-catching. And for people who think that the story about a computer programmer entering a virtual reality world, you obviously haven't seen the Walt Disney masterpiece Tron, which, by the way, had far more groundbreaking technology for its day than the Matrix's effects had when it was first made. Overall, the Matrix is one of the most overrated films I've ever seen and had more attention than it actually deserved. Grade: D"

The plot is very simple and understandable. Second, that this was a great movie. It isn't. The plot is so understandable that it's boring.

We know that because Morpheus (played - well played I concede - by Lawrence Fishburne) tells us. Machines have conquered humanity and taken over. OK. I can think of at least one original Star Trek episode and the entire series Battlestar Galactica that revolved around that. The whole thing takes place inside a series of computer programs. OK. The holodeck on the Starship Enterprise, or any number of movies about Virtual Reality spring to mind. One person (Neo, played by Keanu Reeves) will save the world. Hmmm. Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home: ""Captain Kirk, you and your crew have saved this planet."" In short, there just isn't anything original in this story. How it makes it to #31 on the all time list (at the time of writing) is beyond me.There are some good things in this movie. There must have been a massive special effects budget, because the special effects are superb. No argument there.

Of course I have seen it before, back in the day when it was newly released. But I can't claim to have been much of a fan of the movie or the whole franchise actually. But I opted to sit down and watch them again, prior to sitting down to watch the newest addition to the franchise. But more about that one later.I never got onboard the 'Matrix is an amazing movie' train. Sure, I found the movie to be watchable, but it just wasn't an impressive movie in terms of script and storyline. So writers Lilly Wachowski and Lana Wachowski didn't really impress me back in 1999, and nor was revisiting the movie here in 2021 an eye-opening experience. I just never could delve into that whole artificial reality where the laws of physics and such doesn't apply.Visually then ""The Matrix"" was impressive, no doubt about it. And even today, 22 years later, the movie is actually still rather enjoyable in terms of visual effects and CGI. But a movie can only be sustained so much on visual effects alone.Something that definitely was impressive about ""The Matrix"" was the cast ensemble, because they had gotten together a great cast for the movie. Of course, Keanu Reeves is excellent in the movie, but then again, he does tend to have a track record of that. The movie also have the likes of Laurence Fishburne, Carrie-Anne Moss, Hugo Weaving and Joe Pantoliano on the cast list. Now, back in the day I didn't really like Hugo Weaving, but I must admit that seeing the movie again definitely brings his monotonous performance of Agent Smith to a new light, because he did so rather phenomenally, and always was the star of the movie.I am not a fan of ""The Matrix"" franchise, nor will I ever become so. But I have to say that the amount of action in the movie and the execution of the action sequences was good, and the visual effects definitely helped to keep the movie afloat. But in terms of storyline and script, then ""The Matrix"" was sort of flawed and mundane.My rating of the 1999 action sci-fi from directors Lana Wachowski and Lilly Wachowski lands on a six out of ten stars."

Then Neo turns into Superman: yep,s-o-o-o original. Then there's the bit where Neo is resurrected by the kiss by Trinity. It's ET and Snow White and every other now-predictable cliché in the cannon of story telling. To top that Fishburne's character whispers in hushed awe: ""He's The One"".

Lawrence Fishburne comes off a bit better, but his dialogue is the most pretentious, ridiculous garbage I've ever heard.

""The Matrix"" is astounded by what it perceives as its own brilliance, but for those of us who have thought of its ideas before, there are few surprises. Some people I know were blown away when Neo discovers the truth behind his reality, but I was waiting for something interesting to happen.""The Matrix"" has been praised for its originality, but it suffers from two traditional and clichéd movie formulas. First, Neo is the Chosen One (notice that ""neo"" is an anagram of ""one."" Was this supposed to be suspenseful?) who is destined to save the human race, bring balance to the Force, etc. He dies and comes back to life, like Jesus. Of course, to begin with he was just a pasty hacker in a crummy apartment and an anonymous office job, giving hope to all the spotty teenage geeks in the audience that they too might become the Messiah one day.The second fault is the movie's reliance on action. Instead of coming up with interesting and exciting ways for two people to fight each other in virtual reality, Neo and Co. whip out their guns and start shooting. The techno music begins, and the audience is treated to several slow-motion kicks and scenes of people dodging bullets. I'm not sure how they manage all this, because nobody ever takes off their sunglasses to see properly. If the villains of the movie really were programs in the Matrix, shouldn't they be able to manipulate it without having to resort to kung fu? Anyway, I didn't like this movie.

When the matrix was released I would have gladly rated it a 9, when it was released it was way ahead of it's time with stunning cgi effects and sound effects, if I was rating this movie honestly I would say it deserves a 7.0 , it is still an entertaining film , I dont find myself looking away from the film too often to loose track of what's going on , I understand the story and I do like it unlike many of the other reviewers who rated it honestly a 1 star, I like many others simply believe this movie had it's time in the spotlight and deserves to have a special place in our hearts for nostalgia but I believe there are many other movies far better than this ranked lower than the matrix that are better in every way by a big margin.

It simply has so much to offer... all that food for thought, different beliefs, tons of themes that are explored and such immense room for interpretation, with very little in this being certain or definite. The plot is excellent, develops well, and combines various interesting ideas(and no, they weren't original, they weren't meant to be... this puts a lot of fascinating concepts together, and presents them all for the mainstream audience). Granted, it spawned a ton of suddenly enlightened pocket philosophers with little doubt as to their own prowess, but with anything this influential, there are going to be some negative results. The pacing is spot-on, not a moment of this is too long or overly short. The action is astounding, exciting, fun, entertaining and awesome, and they manage to do amazing and memorable sequences. No, perhaps it does not dodge all of the clichés. The slow-motion(and bits clearly inspired by John Woo) and other tools appeared before this, yes, the point isn't that they were new... it's the way this uses them, and creates a unique style. Mixing Noir, Animé and countless allusions, and doing so with expert-like skill is an impressive feat. The Bullet-Time was invented for this, and it is fantastic. The martial arts, the choreography, the moves, magnificent. The effects are stunning and seamless, to this day. The cinematography and editing are perfect, and enormously well-planned. The mood and atmosphere is masterfully achieved. The acting is quite good, Reeves fits, Moss and Fishburne are marvelous, and Weaving is utterly impeccable. The dialog is almost completely invariably well-written, and well-delivered. There is no nudity or sexuality, at most hints thereof. There is language, moderately harsh, albeit not too bad in frequency. The DVD holds a text introduction(to the following) by the Wachowski's, that makes for a great read, as well as two commentary tracks, one of philosophers who enjoyed the film, Dr. Cornel West & Ken Wilder, and one of critics who did not care for it, Todd McCarthy, John Powers & David Thompson.

They are boring. And the story is very silly. Come on - humans as batteries, programs with families?? Who designed this matrix-thing anyways? It must have been an idiot! The plot barely survives the first time 'round - second time you watch it - it fails. The sad part is that this film is being dragged down in the mud with the two sequels that have been made for the sake of sequels with a combined narrative of about a minute.

Lots and lots and lots of action sequences. You can feel the filmmakers just trying to top the last sequence instead of doing something like advancing the plot or developing the characters. Unless you think the action sequence is the be-all-and-end-all of movies, all that action just gets boring after a while. I have nothing against whiz-bang special effects as long as they do something worthwhile to move the film along (the Lord of the Rings films are good at this). But this is just not happening with the Matrix.The Matrix concept itself is thought-provoking. Why isn't it developed more? The fact that this monumental struggle for the soul of humanity ends up with a shoot-out, a helicopter-dangling rescue sequence and a martial arts fight is almost laughable. It's like saying the mysteries of the universe can be unraveled by watching beer commercials. If you want to see an ending that leaves you with something worth chewing on, you'll be sadly disappointed (as I was).As for other elements of the movie -- Keanu Reeves, as much as I usually enjoy watching him, was extremely wooden. Fishburne and Moss were good at what they did, but their parts were pretty two-dimensional. I couldn't get emotionally involved with any of the characters, which is ultimately the fault of the writers. The cinematography and ""style"" of the film and the sets is pretty cool to look at. However, the whole black clothes and sunglasses motif is just a little bit hokey after a while. And the agents -- I swear they look just like the bad aliens in Brother From Another Planet -- I kept expecting them to shriek at each other.I look at it this way - people who think that sitting in front of their tubes and playing video games is a worthwhile way to spend their lives will probably love this movie. People who want something more will think it's pretty hollow. It's a shame because the concept had a lot of potential, but the filmmakers took the easy way out."
170,185,0.53843325,0.3651157,0.09645102,2,"poor plot, unoriginal quotes, plenty of stereotypes","`I hate those movies based on special effects with a poor plot,' I told my friend when he suggested me to go see `The Matrix' on its opening night. But when I kept hearing excellent reviews of the movie, my curiosity increased, and I decided to give it a try. Well, I was right: not only I did not enjoy the movie, but I also could not wait to rush out of the movie theater.
First of all: the PLOT was truly poor, and it is clear that most of the scenes were designed merely to show special effects, rather than to transmit a precise message (and at least twenty minutes of the movie could have been cut because of this). The first rule of screenwriting is to satisfy the audience's need for orientation, clarifying since the very beginning who are the characters of the movie, and what is their function. I had to wait an hour to understand that. This method (increasing the suspense of this audience by postponing a real explanation of the characters' roles) could have been effective, only if they were introduced in a more clear way. I often felt lost, as many key aspects of the movie were clarified too late (i.e. the phone transportation).
The DIALOGUES were truly lame and unoriginal (except for some funny references to the Wizard of OZ).The CHARACTERS were not developed at all. Still now, thinking about the movie, I cannot really say what was a peculiar trait of each character: their personalities did not stand out at all. They were rather divided into the stereotypical `good' and `bad' categories.
Still mentioning STEREOTYPES, I think the whole movie was a TT (Temple of Testosterone): the ideal place for the satisfaction of a male audience. Why? Because of great fight scenes, vigorous men with a perpetual grimace who want to either save or `own' the world, women with big breasts who don't talk (the woman in red), and strong but yet submissive women driven by sentimentality (Trinity).
What I SUGGEST is to go see it if you like video games and want some entertainment. But if you are one of those persons who want to step out of a movie theater with a new awareness or  even better  a call to action, I suggest you'd save the 8 bucks for a better cause."

When Lee Boyd Malvo, teen half of the alleged D.C. sniper duo, goes on trial for murder in Chesapeake, Va., tomorrow, his attorney confirms that he too will weave ""The Matrix"" into his insanity defense. Malvo told FBI agents that they should ""watch 'The Matrix""' if they wanted to understand him, and jailers found lines of dialogue from the film scribbled on paper in his cell. Even the Columbine killers were ""Matrix"" fans. (From Boston Globe By Mark Schone, 11/9/2003)Neo finds himself in an alternate reality, aware that he once was ""unconscious"" in a computer-generated virtual reality and killers are chasing him. He must resort to fancy footwork and plenty of violence himself in order to save the world. All that he once believed has proved false as he's designated the savoir and learns his secret super powers. What Neo does serves a higher purpose, which gives his violence noble flavor. But that's a movie. Or is it? Apparently, some murder defendants have come to believe they were in the matrix and that killing others was therefore justified. Lee Boyd Malvo, was devoted to the movie. In jail he made many jottings, including a plea that people should free themselves from the Matrix. He told the FBI to watch the film... In San Francisco, Vadim Mieseges, 27, killed and dismembered his landlady, and in his defense he said that he'd been ""sucked"" into the Matrix. In Ohio, Tonda Lynn Ansley also attacked her landlady on this premise, but was certain she had not really done so: it was only a dream. She had targeted three others as well, to free herself from their mind control. In Virginia 19-year-old Joe Cook, who claimed he did not realize what he was doing when he dressed like Neo, grabbed his twelve-gauge shotgun (purchased because it resembled one in the movie), and shot both of his adoptive parents to death.

Unfortunately, this is almost always nearly enough to dupe the public, which is by and large amazingly stupid and take any sprinkling of metaphysical rumination as the work of a genius, as long as it has enough explosions and ickiness mixed in.  The Matrix stars Keanu Reeves as a Block of Wood, or the other way around, being equally valid.

Also, the Holy Black Man, Morpheus, who may or may not represent God or the Holy Ghost, and a generic Judas, who seeks wealth/power through the destruction of Keanu/Christ.  So basically, all that has been done is take the amendment to the Bible (the New and Improved Testament), slap on a lacquer of nihilism, technology, and explosions, no acting ability from the majority of the cast, a handful of plot holes, a reference to ""Alice in Wonderland,"" and you have ""The Matrix,"" the movie that succeeded mainly because it's on the same level as the general public, which is pretty sad.

The camera angle, costume, music, and the gunfights.. all these qualities shine the heroes. The entertainment value of this movie should not be overlooked because of its high quality and philosophy.I can see how much research Wachowski sisters put in to make their imaginations and concepts realized in the two-hour movie in plausible ways. How is dystopian future and present is connected? How does dream within a dream work? All the questions about their imaginary world is answered because they pay attention to details and they explain every existence and terms with logic one step at a time. There is no leap of logic, very tightly well-woven script.Their concept is not just future or imaginary anymore. In 2020, we see AI taking over many of works and jobs that humans used to do and invading privacy. Virtual reality games gain popularity over time, and you see Neo everywhere who adapts quickly in the Internet world and learn the combat game so fast and naturally.The impact of 'The Matrix' in the movie industry is more than imaginable. Of course, revolutionary visual effects with elaborated CGI techniques created iconic bullet-dodging scene of Neo.

This is supposed to be a movie were the Good Guys are fighting the Bad Matrix. But what Matrix is bad is questionable. It takes away people's freedom to control their lives but allows them to live in a bright sunny world, when the real world is dark ruins, ugly closing and food that looks and tastes like plastic. Some people could say that the Matrix is doing a good deed.Not to mention that using a people's bodies as a batteries is not very effective, you have to feed them and that's a real waste of energy.Absolutely unnecessary thing in this film is a Kung Fu. If you can bend spoons and duck bullets with the power of your mind, you don't need any martial arts. It was made only to put some action into film.And the worst thing is a prophecy about the ""Chosen-One"". Neo was the ""Chosen-One"" all the time and it doesn't matter if Trinity would fall in love with him or not. He had his abilities, he trained them and it's logically to assume that he would get them. But no! He fully gets them only when Trinity says she loves him. Yes, it was in Oracles prophecy, but don't You think that the things You can do are not depend from what other people think about You? This is really falls apart, and this is a major moment in movie.To avoid any farther damaging of a Matrix fan's feelings, I must say that this movie is not all that bad.

In no areas of filmmaking is this more true than the action/adventure and sci-fi genres.  Probably the most popular example to date comes in the form of ""The Matrix"", a film that actually chooses as its setting a never-never land located somewhere between reality and the abstract plane of cybernetics.The plot of the film, though too complex to reiterate here, is actually put forward in a fairly straightforward, comprehensible manner.  What is missing from the film is the essential grounding in reality that makes the audience care if the main characters succeed in their mission (to rescue the world of course) or fail.  Unlike say ""Enemy of the State"", which managed to grapple with the potential dangers of an over-computerized and mechanized society in a world with which we are all familiar, ""The Matrix"" takes us to a sci-fi world that never fully engages the audience in even its own reality.  Part of the problem may be that the film's visual designers settle for the conventional sci-fi view of the future world as a series of dark, cramped, fog enshrouded rooms and corridors familiar to us from countless such movies.  We follow the obviously well thought-out and meticulously explained storyline but find ourselves never particularly engaged in the characters or feel any stake in the outcome of the final resolution. As to the film's much vaunted special effects, they are, admittedly at times, intriguing, but since computer graphics now make even the most preposterous situations possible on the screen, the audience craves more than simply scattered moments of jawdropping visuals to engage its full attention.  ""The Matrix""  borders on dullness quite often during its overlong 136 minute running time.  Perhaps a movie that takes place in a world that really isn't a world needs a more engaging central character to make the audience care."

Look at Terminator II, now over twelve years old, the SFX are still ahead of today's standards.The story is basically a cross-over between the Terminator plot (also Blade Runner and a lot more sci-fi movies with the mankind overrun by machine and artificial intelligence idea) and the Dark City setting and ambiance (trench coats, an artificial city). This lack of originality is why, in my humble opinion, the movie's sequels didn't do as well. The acting is OK but far from good and the directing is the same as most 'hollywoodian' movies from the last ten years (IE lacking personal style. Seriously, what's the difference between a Wachowski bros. flick and a Roland Emmerich one?).I've tried to watch it again on several occasions but usually I end up fast forwarding to the main action scene and then turning the movie off and then I get the feeling that that scene resumes the entire movie; a lot of noise about nothing."

The visuals are quite pretty but again are totally lacking in innovation except for the 'Bullet Time' gimmick, which is fun to watch but not as impressive as had been made out. At least it wasn't over-used. Then we move onto the acting: Fishburne is fine, as is Moss, but Keanu drags the film into new depths of rubbishness with his trademark lack of emotion or even the slightest indication of sentience, ruining some lines that should sound great.

Sound design. (Excellent. When I watched all the fight,action scenes the special effects gave a satisfying feedback in my ears when someone landed a punch or got knocked out.)
Cinematography (Feels like they thought about everything and it has that special Matrix feel to everything.)
Characters (Most mémorable are Neo which needs no introduction and agent Smith which has a way to intimidate even the viewer and they both are just iconic legends.)Probably my favourite scenes were the lobby,the rooftop and all the fighting scenes against agent Smith where an underdog just tries anyway even knowing his chances of winning are slim.To conclude I would say people in the year 2070 could watch this and it would still hold up. Would I reccomend it? Yes. Will I watch it again ? It's great but I will most likely watch it again in few years after somehow my life leads back to Neo."

Contrary to what his name suggests, Morpheus cannot actually morph into a character that doesn't induce your eyes to roll.

It is the greatest testament to the inherently hollow nature of our existence and every single ineffective punch delivered to the face of an androidish agent emphasizes that.

Okay. Every one-liner is delivered with straight-faced sophistication and bloated philosophical pretense! But that's cool! In fact, therein lies the quality of this film.

There have been lots of theories regarding it. And the plot is very simple with many plot holes. Neo as the chosen one isn't portrayed correctly. I see no special abilities in him.Fights were really silly and were too long where you get bored and just want to skip them and I see no reason why trinity fell in love with neo when they didn't spend any time together at all , just because a fortune teller told her that she would fell in love with the chosen one , is it how emotions work? Well , I don't think so.Apart from these there are a bunch of positive things too. Special effects were awesome considering that this movie came out in 1999. The idea of the story is innovative for Hollywood and matrix came out in era where there isn't much interest in sci-fi among filmmakers while the thrillers ruled them. So these things made it highly rated back then in 1999.

The whole thing is too dark, and let's be honest: If you've seen the trailer, you don't need to see the film, as it shows you all the special effects there anyway.I've been more disappointed by other films, but I fail to see how this uninspiring and badly acted mess is hailed so much by fans.  Any old fool can string together a series of special effects, the trick is to link them with a good story and enjoyable characters.  The Matrix does neither.

From a plot straight out of a Dick or Gibson novel, to the agony of watching Laurence Fishburne recite pages of truly awful exposition, this is a film that tries really hard, but often misses the mark. To be fair, the film is aiming high and the middle third works really well. The sets, costumes and effects are terrific and the stunts and fight scenes are pretty wild. There are also some nice metaphors playing out, and there is a serious parable being told here. The dialogue during the middle is also sharp and witty, and makes me wonder who wrote the rest of it, particularly all the scenes where Fishburne and Keanu Reeves play Obi Wan and Luke Skywalker. (""The matrix surrounds us, it penetrates us...."" And I thought the next Star Wars movie wasn't coming out until May.) The film can't decide if it wants to be Aliens, Johnny Mnemonic, a Borg episode, a John Woo film, or a Gap ad, so it borrows lots from all of them and ends up being too little of each.

They were not the kind of special affects that are so good you don't notice them.  Those are the best kind of effects, they mesh with the movie so well that they don't distract from the plot, of course The Matrix doesn't really have a plot. The movie tries to be Cyberpunk, it's based on the novel by William Gibson who is a fantastic writer, so I have to assume that the novel is good.  But this movie tries to sort of ask about virtual reality and ""where are we headed?"" and so forth, but it does it so poorly where so many others have done well.  Try reading (that's right, _reading_ Gasp!) Otherland, or Neuromancer, or the Diamond Age or Snow Crash or any of the great cyberpunk novels if you want to know what this movie should have been.

It is all around us. Even now, in this very room. You can see it when you look out your window or when you turn on your television. You can feel it when you go to work... when you go to church... when you pay your taxes. It is the world that has been pulled over your eyes to blind you from the truth.

Its heartening when any highly stylised film which isn't utter base level bilge to take megabucks at the box office.But heres where The Matrix succeeds brilliantly. It offers mind blowing concepts- but isn't too deep. It offers striking visuals- which unfortunately quickly became de rigueur as many other films, commercials and pop videos copied this visual style. Not the fault of the filmmakers and as they say, imitation is the sincerest form of flattery.Certain parts of the film feel like a comic book fans fapfest. The costumes assumed by the main protagonists would only be thought cool by basement dwelling geeks. Black PVC, long coats and clumpy boots- a cyberpunk's wet dream. Soo late 90s.But this film did dare to take to the masses something original and daring. It succeeded. Fair play especially in these times of stale remakes and turgid reboots. But don't try to interpret things too deeply. Beneath the surface isn't a whole lot of depth or substance. Precisely why it was so massive.The scene need the end where we learn that Neo really is 'the one' is one of the most bombastic, unintentionally hilarious sequences in modern cinema. I don't know if its pure cheese, genius or both. Which is noteworthy in itself.But for a film that tries to show us what the modern world is really like and what it revolves around I'll still stick with They Live. A film that accomplishes its mission statement with less gloss, has infinitely more depth, substance and charm and does so on a substantially smaller budget than The Matrix."

Science fiction presumes a basis in an existing or projected law of science. At least this is the principle which gives substance to the wildest speculations of masters such as Arthur C Clarke (who has a first class physics degree). This film is better categorized as a science fantasy, i.e. one where  the authors use the pretence of science as a fig leaf to disguise the total inanity and incoherence of their project. Even fairy tales work within their own framework of law which gives tension and excitement to the surreal adventures. In ""The Matrix"" laws are not even made up as they go along, as that would impede the next stream-of-consciousness stunt. It makes a great special effect if a character leaps tall buildings at  a single bound or recoils from a road surface after falling from a 500 foot building. Unfortunately it also removes any possibility of the audience taking him to be even a far-fetched human character, and hence destroys any possibility of genuine thrills. These creatures can survive being run over by a subway train and even death itself. Hence the most risible Lazarus scene since ""ET"" -Keanu is revived from the tomb by the love of a good woman.You can make tennis easier to play by removing the net and rubbing out the lines; unfortunately you thereby destroy the game.  Similarly The Matrix fails to exist as any sort of half-coherent movie if you want a movie to consist of more than a string of sensational images.Unlike AC Clarke's work, this screenplay fails to betray even a high school awareness of science in ""explaining"" its universe, the war between machines and humans, or the rationale for the machines sucking the life force of humans - not to mention the hokey insertion of an old style soothsayer into this ""scientific"" farago.I give it 2 out 10 - one for sheer chutzpah in raising $60 million on the basis of such a ludicrous script and 1 for set design and special effects combined."

In any case this kind of story isn't a million miles away from Douglas Adams' Hitchhiker's Guide To the Galaxy, a book far more interesting than this rubbish.For the sake of a good story the Wachoowski Brothers (writers & directors) went all gooey for lots of cgi to distract the viewer with the many plotholes and poor character development. The story simply gets in the way of a good sfx. And on and on it goes, each cgi trying to out ""wow"" the previous effect to the point where you wonder whether this is nothing more than an expensive computer game.People went wild when we saw our heroes climb up walls, jump huge rooftops & dodge speeding bullets in slowmo. But so what? I feel we have become so blaise about cgi that only our imagination limits us to what we think is possible. And the cgi in this film no longer had the same kind of ""jaw dropping"" effect as one witnessed in Star Wars, Terminator 2 or even 2001:Space Odyssey.Our superheroes, Keanu Reeves, Laurence Fishbourne & Carrie Annie Moss, looked like bit players compared to the computer bits making up the over indulgent CGIs. Fishbourne tries to come over all cool & hip, but looks fairly average when asked to do anything remotely interesting; Reeves acts just like...well...Reeves, with that usual ""no one's home"" expression & designer jackets. While Moss hops in & out of the movie when it looks as if the going's getting a bit tough for Reeves, resulting in an ending ripped straight from Luc Besson's 5th Element!This film lives off its own hype & marketing, and already looks dated.

Supposedly set in the future but conventional weapons, aircraft, architecture etc seem to be the only things available.

This is groundbreaking visual stuff and is backed by extraordinary electronic/metal music and really cool sets.It is a visual and literal ""Rage Against the Machine"" that is fully realized in its display of a deadpan humor and dead-on violence. This was the ride of the decade and brought a new look to the new millennium.It's not without some flaws and faults, mainly that the matrix is so complex and complicated that its own concept had to be ""bent and broken"" to allow for some of the story to translate to an acceptable theatrical experience. At least to its targeted mainstream audience. In the hands of a quirky and edgy Director it could have been done with more ""in house logic"", but then it would be quite a different experience.The whole concept of a Messiah and ""The One"" is kind of elementary in an extreme exploitation such as this but that only drops it a notch from the best of Sci-Fi and does nothing to hold this exhilarating experience back from being quite entertaining, if on a lesser level."

What gets me is all the people who act like this movie is so original.  What is original about it?  It is basically a combination of the Terminator movies and any number of virtual reality movies that were released prior to this one including Johnny Mnemonic also starring Reeves.  Heck, it wasn't even the first movie to use bullet time as the movie Blade was the first time I had seen that done in a movie, granted on a much smaller scale.  Also, I think it was seen in a Korn music video as well before this movie ever came into being.  So this movie just borrows, for the most part, from a bunch of different movies and other entertainment.  Still it is good, though the parts that are the best take place in the matrix.  Some of the real world scenes are quite frankly boring.  The second time I watched this one I was basically thinking, ""Come on, capture Morpheus already so we can get to the good part of the flick"". The action at the end of this movie, more than makes up for the many dry spells in the flick.  Reeves and Fishburne are good as well, though I could have done without some of their talking scenes and their fight wasn't anything special either.  Like I said, I loved the movie when they were in the matrix and not as much when they weren't.  I hear the third installment will be entirely set in the real world too, so I don't have high hopes for it.  Carrie Ann Moss wasn't anything special in this either...if it wasn't for this movie who would ever of heard of her?  Let's face it, you could have put anyone in that role and they could have performed just as well are better.  She isn't very good looking either.  All in all it is worth checking out cause of the great action at the end, and because Hugo Weaving is great as the villain."

Its brother team of directors deserve no reward for any technical gimmickry that might momentarily wow an asocial ticket-buyer, because their ignorance (read it ""sense of what was hot last week"") and disdain for the human component--for people as the best or worst of us really talk and think (or view and listen) damages even actors who know better, such as Lawrence Fishburn.

271,298,0.49743277,0.35058212,0.15198506,8,Real deal sci-fi.,"This is a ludicrous film. Loud, brash and generally bombastic at every turn. Fortunately, it knows this and wears these features on its sleeve. It is knowing and ironic and has its tongue firmly in its cheek. The ideas, which will no doubt be hailed as 'startlingly original', are all stolen from Philip K. Dick, but at least its stealing from the best. It is basically familiar territory, territory mined by Dark City only a few years back. The Matrix, however, is an immeasurably superior film, simply by virtue of the fact that it does not take itself seriously. At times, the characters play their ludicrous lines so deadpan, it achieves a bizarre spooflike quality. Fishburne's performance, in particular, is splendidly arch as he delivers lines like 'Welcome to the desert of the real' with a misplaced Shakespearean grandeur.The effects are also ground-breaking and mostly effective. The use of slo-mo to eroticize the violence is reminiscent of Woo or even Peckinpah but with the use of clever CGI, Matrix achieves the feel of ballistic science. The shootouts do not revel in the familiar 'operatic grandeur' that has been a staple since Bonnie and Clyde. Rather, they play like FBI reconstructions of shootouts. We see the paths that bullets take, the positions of spent shell casings. It is shamelessly fetishistic and utterly irrelevant to the film's central idea but spectacular and exciting nonetheless.I hate virtually everything. Dark City was a nauseating waste of my time. Everything released over the last three summers has seemed despicably lazy film making. Godzilla, Armageddon...these films are offensive cynical money pits without a single grain of wit, a single interesting idea to tie the whole rotten mess together. Therefore, I fully anticipated hating the Matrix with equal vigor. As it was, I was pleasantly surprised. While I would make no claims that it was in any way a classic, it certainly appeared to have been put together with a great deal of love and humour and these attributes go a long way. It was overlong and unnecessarily portentous at times but these are minor quibbles when one is being bombarded by such a wealth of outrageous imagery and ideas. What other film could link Dick, Christ, Alice in Wonderland, Monty Python, Woo, Jackie Chan,  and still find time to make Keanu Reeves look good?"

The wardrobe is a rip-off of T2 and BLADE, for the heroes, and MIB for the bad guys. The gunfights are Hong-Kong inspired. So are the fight scenes. Those are only a few of the influences I've spotted. This movie did not reinvent the wheel, but it's still gives the movie goer quite an eyeful and does what it's supposed to, which is to entertain. All the stories have been told, it's all in the ""how"" you tell the story. This one had a cool style and some innovative special effects.

I mean Saturday morning cartoons are better written than this, not even good cartoons either, I think that the average episode of Voltron or Scooby Doo have more meaningful and profound scripts. The main characters can't even manage to be two dimensional. The ugly: The acting is hideous, and I'm not just talking about the spoken lines. I can almost hear Keanu saying ""dude"" after every line. Fishburne is also attains a whole new level of corniness, Mumra on Thundercats levels of melodrama. As in another over-hyped movie, Crouching Tiger etc. etc., no amount of special effects can disguise the fact that these people do not know martial arts. The fight scene between Fishburne and Reeves made me laugh out loud, and not in a happy way, more of a ""I can't believe how pathetic this is"" kind of defensive laugh. Hong Kong movies made in the late seventies have better wirework. The cookie cutter villain is actually the most compelling character, and that my friends is sad. This is what really makes me nauseous: Two more movies are coming out. Umm... did I miss something here? I thought that the movie's only redeeming quality was the ""surprise"" midway through when we found out what ""The Matrix"" was. There's not much sequel material here to work with.The first half of this movie is decent in that it doesn't really insult the viewer. As soon as Reeves wakes up in the tank, the movie becomes a laughable, pretentious Saturday morning cartoon. Junior high kids should eat it up, but any reasonably intelligent person who has read a book in his or her life will take absolutely nothing from this move of any lasting value.

How can anyone say that this isn't exactly the way that reality is? To try and disprove this view of reality would be like trying to disprove the existence of God. Maybe he's there, maybe he isn't, but no one can possibly prove it either way. It works the same way for The Matrix. It is possible that everything that we see is fed into our minds by machines and that we would never know it. Probably the only remotely convincing argument the other way would be that if that were true, why would the machines give us a movie like this to watch? It would expose them! But then again, maybe they just want to get us thinking, maybe to see how we'll react to the possibility of their existence. Maybe they are getting ready to present themselves to us. Robot rapture! Who can say that the Wachowski brothers are not messengers?
This is by far the best science fiction film that I have ever seen. Aside from the relatively plausible story, every other element of the film was spectacular! The special effects (which, in my opinion, usually take more away from a film than they add) were awesome, the fight scenes were incredibly intense, and the pace of the film itself was breathtaking. Every hole is covered up brilliantly, even down to a definition of deja-vu and a possible reason for why so many different foods taste like chicken. These little ties to reality are one of the best ways that this film was able to come off so realistically. The Matrix is absolutely not to be missed. Even people who don't like science fiction or even action films will more than likely enjoy this film. It is well presented, it is not unnecessarily excessive, and it presents the most innovative camera work in years. It has something for everyone, and will become a science fiction classic without a doubt."

I first watched this film when I was merely 12, and was absolutely blown away by it, and rewatching it now, i'm so glad to catch so many little things that add to the depth of this film and its storytelling. The Wachowski's have created something masterful here, creating a dystopian sci-fi world unlike any other before it and managing to not only build upon it greatly throughout the film but allow the audience to be immersed within it as well. It's a movie that makes you think, and it may start off a bit slow because of that, but it knows what it's trying to do, and it doesn't need to apologize for it. Keanu Reeves, Laurence Fishburne, and Carrie-Anne Moss provide for excellent leads throughout the film. The cinematography is unique and gritty, its action style more than entertaining, and its deeper themes of societal norms and challenges make for quite an interesting commentary. Its special effects may not have aged very well today, but at the time they were quite unique and it fits the films vibe in a way that truly has to be seen to be believed. In the end, The Matrix is a sci-fi masterpiece and no one can tell me otherwise.

I wasn't entirely sure what was going on when it came to the story at that time. But all I knew was that is was really cool. It's a bit outdated now but it still left a mark in cinema and inspired a lot of movie and more to come. The story is actually very creative and has sci-fi philosophical elements that is well blended into the story and isn't forced. And the dialogue is even cool and interesting. I am not going to get in depth with the story but I will just say that it's pretty clever without it being overly complex. This is probably Keanu Reeves's trademark movie and I can't picture anyone else taking the role of Neo besides him. And glad that someone like Will Smith didn't end up with this role. Nothing against Will Smith but Keanu Reeves is just the better candidate. He was just perfect for a movie like this and fit the image of a average cool hacker that gets picked or chosen to do something much much greater. Even the mentor character Morpheus(Laurence Fishburne) and the main villain Agent Smith played by Hugo Weaving are excellent choices for the roles they were given. The action was super cool and even amazing when this movie first came out. In fact it's the first movie I seen that blends slow motion and bullet time in a effective manner in a movie.

294,324,0.23299693,0.50785166,0.2591513,9,A gorgeous film that demands subsequent discussion,"I've put off writing this review for ages because I feel as though I could never do a classic like The Matrix (1999) justice. I happily panned Matrix: Revolutions as a disappointing end to a fantastic trilogy, but I dare not touch the original film. There is no way I could capture its innovative brilliance on paper, because the film is a visual experience. So I'll just throw out as much rambling, semi-coherent praise as I can muster.I imagine that when the Wachowski brothers approached the film studio with a storyline that went something like this: ""a hacker in the near future discovers that the universe and the world he is living in is nothing more than a dream--and elaborate computer programme called the Matrix controlled by machines as a means to dominate humanity"" all they got were raised eyebrows from executives. Yet, somehow, they must have convinced them to finance the project, because The Matrix is 65 million dollar production, sparing no expense at glorious visual effects and science fiction elements.It puts forward totalitarian ideas like many dystopian films, but it adds more depth to them, more philosophy and more relevant notions. What's more is that it approaches and treats these in a much more effective way. It is difficult to pinpoint exactly how, but most of its content is communicated through dialogue (Morpheus telling Neo about the Matrix and what it means) and stunning visuals. Just like Terminator, it tells us that A.I. will grow stronger and eventually spiral into thinking minds of its own, leading to the demise of mankind. Unlike Terminator however, The Matrix tells us the machines are hiding this fact, creating an illusion. We are living in a dream world. That is enough to make you question a few things.The Matrix catalyzed a whole new style of film-making and it is referenced to, spoofed and homaged in literally hundreds of films just a couple of years after its release in 1999. Even children's animations like Shrek features Matrix segments (Fiona rising in the air Trinity-style, battling forest rangers). So it is safe to say this film has had considerable influence on contemporary films.As the trilogy drags on, the novelty of the fresh science fiction mixture and special effects has worn off; the ideas are no longer as riveting; the story itself becomes too widely-scoped to grasp and with an opening films of such flair, it is setting itself up for disappointment. But The Matrix alone is a near-perfect film.9 out of 10"

Otherwise, the characters and story-line are utterly uninspired and unoriginal. Repeated viewings have been rather painful Keanu Reeves is within his element by playing the utterly clueless protagonist (see Bill & Ted). People have often praised the story for raising such existential questions, but I feel the same question was approached and done much more effectively in movies such as The City of Lost Children and Dark City.

The atmosphere is suitably dark and the special effects are excellent. All good enough for a fine evening of movie entertainment, right? Unfortunately there are some rather big problems as well, and they really bug me the morning after watching the film. Truth is, I am really struggling with the plot. I am quite a fan of science-fiction so that in itself is not what bothers me. I don't even mind the questionable assumption that human bodies can be harvested for power generation without having to input more energy than they produce. No, the real doubt I have is simply: why this Matrix? Why do the machines even bother to go to such lengths as this incredibly complicated computer programme that makes humans think they have an actual life? Why not just let them rot in their pods and good luck to them? What do the machines get out of it? Surely it costs vast amounts of energy to keep this programme running and hook up all the humans to it? Why do they do it? What's the point? Also, why do Special Agents have any limitations at all? If they are computer programs, and the world they operate in is a computer programme too, why are they not simply all-powerful and invulnerable to bullets and other attacks? A computer programme has no physical limitations - anybody with a games console knows this. Why bother shooting at a virtual body with virtual bullets? I realise these are fundamentals required for the plot to work, but I find the problems a bit too glaring to overlook. When you think about it, this film is no more than an excuse for the (in themselves quite good) special effects. Therefore, in the cool light of day I can't give this film more than 4 stars."

That scene where Neo does the crazy bend back to dodge the bullets thing was purely amazing. Very unique storyline what with turning humans to batteries. That was just brilliant.

People jumping onto a ""cool"" bandwagon","Once in a while a film comes along that everyone has to like, whether its any good or not doesn't matter. The hype and the fact that it has `cool' elements in it,  like killing at the drop of a hat, dark glasses and long leather coats and of course special effects, make up for that. Examples include Blade Runner, which was truly awful, Heat (zzzzzzzzzzzz),  Pulp Fiction, which was good, but not unbelievably wonderful as everyone rants on about and Men in Black which was utter c**p of the highest order (see my review). The Matrix disappointed me unbelievably. I love the Wachowski's previous film `BOUND' and looked forward to this film on the strength of that, NOT the hype.  I watched it in the summer of its release,  on the same day as `Ten Things I hate about you' and `Cruel Intentions' and I must say that I enjoyed those films far more. I had heard `THE MATRIX' was the best film ever made, a cinematic masterpiece, a wonderful story etc although, I always go into every film with an open mind and make my own mind up (even Burn Hollywood Burn  which yes, was awful anyway!!). The Matrix bored me silly for the first hour or so, it didn't make the slightest bit of sense and reminded me of the pain of sitting through `Bladerunner' years before. What I will say is that it picked up in the second half, mainly due special effects  which I always say, should be only an element of a film, NOT the be all and end all. I do honestly believe that many (not all) people only like this film because its fashionable to do so, although will never admit it. If you want good sci fi action thriller, that was made at a shaving of the cost, watch the superior `PITCH BLACK'. Please be individual and make up your own mind and not follow the crowd."

Each scene and each conversation seemed to be carefully chosen and put together so as to convey the plausibility of the matrix.Then coupled with the great story was almost equally fantastic directing and special effects. Before ""The Matrix"" none had tried or adequately tried the still shot and pan. Almost immediately into the movie we get to see a shot of Trinity (Carrie-Ann Moss) jumping in the air, then being frozen perfectly still while the camera pans around her, before she proceeds to kick butt. This movie had no shortage of special effects and action blended it perfectly with critical and revealing dialogue."

The story doesn't progress and you're just waiting for the story to start and progress. The main reason you would want to see this movie is because of the special effects and at some points a lot of action is going on but... the story isn't going anywhere which makes you feel like the movie just goes on and on and on...

Possibly it is the dreamlike quality of the movie that makes it a classic. There are some scenes visually compelling, if not really beautiful (e.g. the green insect penetrating Neo's body). But the excessive martial arts sequences were at first annoying and then, as they became more frequent, I was just bored by them (just as in Charlie's Angels, if this comparison is politically correct). Obviously martial arts are fashionable, but I never cared for Bruce Lee either. In general, The Matrix forgot about its lofty aspirations as it drew towards its end, turning into a plain action movie with endless special effects, fireworks, shooting, and all, even with a helicopter. But what about the very idea of the Matrix? Isn't it just nonsense? After all, if machines took control of the world, using human beings as ""batteries,"" these machines could easily put the poor humans into a perpetual coma, leaving them without consciousness, a state in which they would even spend less energy to sustain themselves, making the whole thing more efficient for the machines. Such human beings would not need any surrogate reality; the Matrix, which is not only a complex box of tricks, but also a waste of energy, would become obsolete."

Which is odd. I remember abstractly thinking along those lines long before ever seeing this movie. And I was a teen when I first saw the matrix movies. And I didn't think the Matrix presentation of the concept was any better than a lot of the imagined ideas I had had in my own head. In the end, until we can demonstrate any matrix-like-reality (Like what Neo gets when he takes the pill) it's all just mental masterbation. And although there is nothing wrong with mental masterbation, I find that it's best if you invent a fun fantasy while you're already in that realm if you're going to bother. I've never felt that the Matrix world was fun and never found it very compelling because it's so divorced from the only reality I really know. I couldn't really relate or empathize with any of the protagonist characters. Perhaps thr reason for this is that the characters in the story are constructed to be symbols for other things rather than just interesting and relatable in their own right to the typical person."

The effects, sound, action, plot, acting were all great.
If you have not seen the Matrix for a while but you are afraid that your memory is rose tinted - watch it again. It really is as good as you remember.Reloaded
We return to the world of the Matrix with Neo and his new found powers.
At first there is so much good stuff here.
We get some post apocalyptic real world and some new interesting characters.
Except the real world stuff is boring and the new characters are stupid.
This was a struggle to watch, despite the amount of action, it was very boring and I cared little about what happened.Revolutions
We are back again. Are we in the Matrix are we in the real world? Does it even mater?
It turns out not.

The fight scenes, with cool bullet dodging, guns , helicopters, all the martial arts, it was all so exciting, apart from two scenes that always freaked me out. Neo's mouth going missing and when Neo gets the bugs in and out of his stomach, plus I might add the baby scene too, when Neo is born again. But other than that it was just a cool movie with cool clothes.But boy was it even better to watch it as an adult. The complexity and symbolism throughout every scene is so detailed. It's almost as if every line is deeply thought out and chosen. Concepts that were way too hard as a kid like the connection of the ship being called Nebuchadnezar, being connected with dreams and reality. Or the white rabbit and Alice in Wonderland references. Each of these tip offs were sp exciting, especially what occurs in Neos interactions with the people coming to his door. How did I miss the lines of them saying wake up. Neo spends the first half of the movie asking so many questions. It was also great to see how times have changed from 1999 technology and the phones used in the office scenes.The acting and casting is superb in this movie. I love every character. Hugo Weaving, Keanu Reeves especially display one of the best faces off battles of good versus bad that I've scene. And that gun scene in the foyer has the be thee most insane shoot out fighting scene in movie history. The fighting is so impressive.

I wasn't a fan of the slow mo and the style of this movie. So when this changed movies my hatred was only reinforced.Fast forward twenty years where I've learned to love Kung fu and tolerate slow mo. The Matrix was added to Netflix and since it was free I decided to give it another shot and absolutely loved it. Still not a fan of the style but it doesn't ruin the movie. I of course see how it's cool, it's just not my thing.This is one of the best written movies ever. The way the story unfolds is genius. Because you are getting a lot of information from what is the matrix to it's origin and it all flows very naturally. Very hard to do. The concept is genius and brilliantly executed. They really explore every aspect of this world and utilize it well.Keanu... I used to think he was awful. Watching this now I don't think that. Sure he has a few not great lines, enough to pounce on for a hater. But he is really good. He is very subtle. Something only a confident actor can do. Which the teenage me couldn't pick up on.I have gone on to watch the other two and loved them and now am a huge matrix fan and have watched them many times since. Reload took me two watches to realize what the brothers were doing, one movie split in two.It's fun to discover this movie now because they don't make them anymore. Big budget, ambitious movies.

You have to watch it to know and have to watch it again to find the details that make it such an epic movie. Even by today's standards of special effects, it stands out and holds its own.
I have heard they are doing a new matrix movie. I hope if they do that they don't stray away from the movie to much. I hope they don't forget about the generation that grew up with it.. We see alot of new movies that target the young blood and forget those who loved them from the 90s.
To me it would only work with original cast and keeping in tune with the original movies.

But it's much more than just another action movie. It's one that raises pertinent questions to the philosophy of what life really is. Praise should be awarded to the Wachowski's for creating the most original science-fiction film since 'Star Wars'. Although the main ideas of the film are difficult to grasp, the Wachowski's have created a modern adaptation of Plato's Allegory of the Cave by placing it in the technologically advanced world we live in today making it easier for modern audiences to understand. The key to the film's success however does lie in it's spectacular action sequences and pioneering special effects that still continue to amaze audiences today. Amazingly choreographed by legendary action choreographer Woo-ping Yuen, the action sequences are ones that are still unmatched in their amazement even today. Whether you are in the mood for thinking and delving into the questions of whether the life we live is real or simply looking for a good dose of 'bullet-time', then The Matrix is the film that will satisfy any film-goer as it continues to this day to be one of the most original films ever made."

Yes, there was films such as 'Blade Runner' and 'Star Wars', but nothing else that had set a standard. Right when you thought there was no specialty, 'The Matrix' miraculously fixed that problem...The Matrix is undeniably a brilliant film, as well as an outstanding experience. Yes, this film has some sort of flaws, but forget that, it has a creative and highly addictive world of it's own. I literally got sucked into this film till the very end. The script, performances, direction, and visual effects are memorable.A script (in my opinion), is the most important part of an amazing 'sci- fi' film. This film's script is jarring and exuberant. The whole idea of 'Matrix' is creative and delusional. This word does come from Mathematics, but this is a whole new meaning. Finely written storytelling at it's very best.Keanu Reeves is NOT an actor I admire. I find him dull and blank most of the time. This film, however, proves me wrong. He, as the main character, is damn good. He's slick, tall, and handsome. Laurence Fishburne, as Morpheus, is brilliant. He demonstrates a better understanding of 'Matrix' and is serious, expressionless, and jubilant. The rest of the cast including Moss and Weaving produce fine performances.The Wachowski brothers do an outstanding job at directing this film. Relating Japanese style towards an American film. The Hollywood FHX in this film is ground-breaking and highly praise. Different camera angles are also used to shoot this film.It may seem surprising, but this film was ONLY acclaimed for it's visual effects. It deserved more, but didn't get any! Otherwise, this visual effects of this film are the highlight and the most related to Hollywood's biggest achievements. The different 'kung-fu' fights are so well done, that you have a great time with them. These effects also made this film look slick and extremely cool.Overall, you shouldn't be missing 'The Matrix' if you are fond of this genre. It exemplifies a perfect well-done thriller.

I had seen little advertising except for the poster at the cinema and I did not know what to expect. 1 minute into the film and I was awestruck. I am not sure exactly what i had just seen. Visually it was the most unique thing Id ever seen, and only 3 minutes had passed. Then we move onto story telling, we are faced with Alice in Wonderland and down the rabbit hole references. I knew then that this was going to be interesting. Slowly Layers were peeled away until boom it hits you right in the face, it actually draws your breath and moves you in such a way that I had never experienced watching a film thus the Matrix is revealed. Some amazing action scenes follow including the lobby scene which for me is still the best action sequence scene I've ever seen. Just when you think it can't get any better we have the ending....... NO..... the hairs stand up on the back of your neck and you are instantly touched by... something. By the time i had walked out of the cinema and got about 100 yards down the road I turned around. I went straight back and watched the next showing. I watched the film 8 times at the cinema over the next few weeks, demanding friends come and see it. Now I have probably seen the film many times since ( 100 ). I know there are flaws but then when you see a flaw you can also somehow justify it. As a stand alone film it is the best Sci Fi movie of all time. Fans wanted more and 2 more films arrived.

It made the movie a million times better! The reason I was blown away again when I watched it was because of the storyline itself. It just comes together so well. About this perception of reality and the human race living in an artificial world made sense for all the action-packed sequences to cross boundaries. If you like the movie for the action, that's fine. but if you want a full blown movie, here it is. The Y2K of film. The movie makes sense story wise, emotionally, and even if you judge the action to look phony, it'll all make sense when you see it. Perfect film.

Oh, yes, the visuals are great. Maybe the only contribution of this movie is the release of more or less new FX that could be used in further, more intelligent movies. It is incredible how so many inconsistencies can be found in the plot without making this movie lose a bit of its undeserved legend. Here are a few of the details that made this film unbearable to me:Machines are obtaining energy from biological sources. And from all the living creatures populating this world, it is the human race that is being used, when hundreds of species would have been much more efficient ""batteries"", without having to create a Matrix to have them comfortable in their sleep - The Matrix is a virtual world designed to keep battery-people happy in their dreams. However, the battle happens precisely in this imaginary world, which has no sense. You can even diein this electronic world and your real body dies, too!!! - After being flushed away when he wakes up, Neo is rescued with an enormous device that was ready to act under the very nose of the machinesBeyond FX, the movie is absolutely boring. You could always disconnect your brain and simply watch at the action, and rate this movie more or less high as an inoffensive entertainment. But then you must face all that incredible mythology built up around this movie, as if it showed a new philosophy or some scientific value!

Well, one thing is the story.The humans believe they live in a normal world in 1999, but in reality it is 200 years later. The world as we know it, was destroyed in a war between robots and humans. While the humans believed they could stop the robots by cutting off their power supply, the robots outsmarted them and made slaves of the humans, who produce more than enough energy to sustain the robot society. But to keep the humans happy and unaware of their actual situation, the robots have created a virtual world, a false version of 20th-century life. This virtual world is called 'the Matrix'. Neo has always been looking for the truth behind the Matrix and one day he gets the opportunity to find it out, thanks to Morpheus. Morpheus is one of the few humans who once managed to escape and he has been searching for the 'chosen one', the only human who will be capable of defeating the robots. He believes Neo is the one he has always been looking for...Next to the story, it is the special effects that have made this movie legendary. I guess everybody already knows this, but this was the first movie in which they have used the super slow-motion, called bullet time. Of course this was a revelation at the time, but even after all these years it's incredibly nice to watch. And there are more interesting things to be found. The makers have used computer animation to its full extend and have done that in an outstanding way. But next to the well developed story and the amazing special effects, there are still the actors. Sometimes, you might almost forget about them, but they still play an important role in this movie and have done that in a very good way.As a conclusion I just want to say that this is probably the very best Sci-Fi movie ever. It's full of action, it has a good story, a lot of interesting special effects and some nice acting. What could you possibly want more from a movie? I reward it with an 8/10. I'm sure this will remain a classic, even in 20 years time."

Here you got the hero named Neo, a computer hacker who is tracked down by a relentless villain named Smith. The scary part when Smith put this ""bug"" that entered Neo's navel, and the team had to track it and flush him out. Then you have this leader named Morpheus(Fishburne) who teaches Neo the ways of the warrior. I liked the training scene where Morpheus and Neo learn Wing-chun and the way they defy gravity was just awesome. And the speed, it's just phenomenal, I'm at complete loss of words for that. I liked the part where Neo evades the bullets being fired by Smith. And the way Smith moved was just unbelievable.The fighting scene is the best part of the movie, and the reason why I liked it is because it's not your typical scifi movie you'll ever see.

Like George Lucas did with Star Wars, Andy and Larry Wachowski create a fascinating world with a different history. Everybody thinks the year is 1999. But in the real world it is closer to 2099 and the world is a very different place. Our reliance on machines has backfired and they have taken over, harvesting humans and connecting them to a system called the matrix, where humans live and think like it is modern day. The story follows of a group of rebels who escaped the matrix who find who they think is their savior, Neo (Keanu Reeves). What follows is an action-packed thrill ride, with an excellent story, and a perfect performance by Hugo Weaving, who plays Agent Smith, a computer program assigned to stop any human resistance.The action scenes completely blow you away. With old-school wire fu, they create a classic sparring session between Neo and Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne). And with extraordinary special effects, they crafted one of the best action sequences ever made in the lobby shootout. Tons of bullets, bodies, and shattered walls fill the screen while a great soundtrack blasts across the room. It has to be seen.While the two sequels were very good, they didn't come close to living up to the first installment, that has set a new standard for science-fiction that will take a heck of a lot to reach. 8/10"

WIERD, MAN!I, of course, think completely otherwise.Yet, this movie, like many others, has what seems to be an anti-technocracy attitude. I disagree with that observation too, because this film is all about how bad choices can make things go wrong, and how good ones can make them better. Not because technology is bad, but because those who weild it has ""the smell"", and I too feel, sometimes, ""saturated"" by it. it is obnoxious and it is our greatest and foremost weakness as a specie. Yet the movies shows that there is a diffrence between knowing the path and walking on it.As a determinist, I do not belive in free choice. I do agree that the illusion is mighty, and the movie depicts exactly that. What is important, after all, is to feel good about yourself and accept your fate. Don't mind the reality - stick to what you are and embrace what you consider is good and true in yourself and then, things would SEEM righter.So THAT, in my part, is the greatness of this movie over thousnds of others.

My mind just blanked it out.  Not only is this device as old as time, but it doesn't involve the audience at all.  It's like we're just listening in.  It would have been better for Neo to actually experience it firsthand and find out exactly what the reality is around him and how it came to be.  I found the FX to be pretty cheesy as well.

The effects are, quite rightly, considered great and are obviously influential in many ways.  But other than a couple of action sequences at the beginning and end, you have nothing but dull lectures.  Lawrence Fishburne is too good an actor to play a second-rate Yoda like this and the ""philosophy"" was the type of thing you outgrow in 10th grade (""How do we REALLY know reality?"") presented in an ultraserious tone that makes the claptrap seem important.  This type of thing has been done before and better, and the various plot holes and inconsistancies were just a sign of sloppy storytelling.  The villains were quite probably the least interesting in the history of film, with tiresome mannerisms that made you want to go out and slap the director.  And the cliches!  Villains in suits and black sunglasses!  A traitor in the heros' midst!   Man redeemed due to love a woman!

That feeling lasted untill the now legendary fight scene in the imaginary dojo. After this point the movie takes a huge step away from the style and course they laid out in the beginning. It got worse and worse as the movie wore on, and I seriously considered stopping the movie. I hadn't been as disappointed since Jurassic Park. If the moviemakers had just remembered to keep up the the innovative and awesome plotline, and not let it degenerate into one special effect after another, it could have been one of the greatest movies of our time.

It's too bad it's coming out this time of year, it has all the potential to be a huge summer hit, and it is sad that its accomplishments will probably be dwarfed by Phantom Menace.  This has some of the nicest camera work I've ever seen (some of it similar to Lock, Stock & 2 Smoking Barrels).  This movie also manages to create whole world, in the same way that Dark City did.  All in all, this is probably one of the best sci-fi flicks of the decade, and it is certainly much more innovative in its special effects than Phantom Menace seems to be.PS: don't be scared of the fact that Keanu Reeves is in this, he does a good enough job not to ruin the picture"

After the last few years of trash that has come out of hollywood, with the same old crap storylines, but with piles of effects. At Last a movie that made me forget I was just watching a film, forget that I was even in a cinema.  For the first time since Leon, I got completely caught up in the movie, forgetting that it was just a bunch of actors going through a routine, but a well crafted, clever, original movie.  From the first scene, when I found myself going 'f**k me' I was captivated into the world of the Matrix.  I won't spoil it for anyone by talking about the plot, but only to say, if you haven't seen it..GO.  I believe this will be a milestone for future films, hopefully they won't just be copies, but will make filmmakers think about making something clever and entertaining.In summary a great film, very original, very clever special effects and wonderful fight scenes."

Possibly one of the most unbelievable and stupid movies of our time. The whole plot was beyond comprehension and not very well organized to say the least. The only way to tell what world they were in was Keanu's hair. Yeah, that's creative. I would rather eat nails than see this horrid excuse for a movie again."

I had it on VHS and watched it more times than I care to remember. Heard it was showing on TV so I thought I'd put on the DVD (in case they cut anything out). I hadn't seen the first film for many years and was really looking forward to it. I was glued to the screen like never before. This was not just nostalgia, it was all those years of growing as a person, as a film lover and as someone who is probably much harder to please/entertain than my teenage self! Revisiting a film I loved as a teenager, I fully accepted the possibility that I would be left feeling a little deflated. I was not. It is perfect. Every. Single. Moment. It is a masterpiece IMHO. I am not one to look for faults (there are none anyway), I prefer to just sit back and enjoy the work and passion everyone involved in a film has put into it. The cast is stellar, the look, style and feel is absolutely stunning and the soundtrack seems even more fitting and perfectly in tune with it after all these years. The camera work and editing are so refreshing after seeing so much hyperspeed in modern films. The balance is just right here because you can follow everything that happens and you can actually see everything, without having to rewind 10 times or freeze frame for important details that are so easy to miss. The Matrix is a shining example of the Sci-Fi genre and has remained in my top 5 all these years. It's back at number 1 too. I absolutely love it!"
438,478,0.1692575,0.4385577,0.39218467,7,Philosophy for beginners,The commitment to CGI/VFX was and is groundbreaking. Keanu is peak mid-career Keanu. The plot and concepts are firing arrows into the air that - based on the really average sequels - never land.The philosophical aspects haven't aged with time - they were dated when this first came out. It's metaphysics for people that never asked what goes into their burger.

And then it goes downhill... and keeps going downhill, not only for the rest of the film, but through two sequels. It becomes ugly and unpleasant, it loses all appeal, it becomes repetitive and boring, it engages in endless action scenes where nothing is ever at stake, it confuses the audience to the point that they give up even trying to make sense of things... Meanwhile, the characters are never developed, and the story goes nowhere. Complete and utter b.s."

The Greek, and original, version of ""Know Thyself"", (Gnothi Seauton), was inscribed in the forecourt of the temple to Apollo at Delphi, the site of the Delphic Oracle, the most important Oracle in the classical Greek world. Plato employs the fundamental principle of 'Know Thyself' extensively in his books by having the character of Socrates use it as the means of motivational emphasis in his dialogues.
